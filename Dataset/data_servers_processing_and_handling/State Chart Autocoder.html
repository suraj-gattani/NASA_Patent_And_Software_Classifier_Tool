This NASA technology automatically generates code from UML/SysML state-machine models specified in the MagicDraw modeling tool. Input is saved as XML data files, and output is provided by the state-machine implementation code in C, C , Python, or Promela. A test suite validates output products, and a test harness allows a developer to execute and animate a model with a graphical state-machine monitor. This monitor can run as either a standalone tool or as an Eclipse plug-in to MagicDraw.
