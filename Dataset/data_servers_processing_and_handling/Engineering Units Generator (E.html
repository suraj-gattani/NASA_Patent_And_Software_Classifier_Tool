EUGEN converts digitized sensor output voltage data to engineering units. The tool creates individual processed data files (one file per transducer per test run), converting raw voltage to meaningful measurements such as pressure or temperature. Engineering Units are generated by the Low Speed Data Processing System (LSDPS) in addition to performing calculated values or parameters at different levels in order to provide the customer with the final data product. LSDPS utilizes the NIST REFPROPS program to calculate thermo-physical properties over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. Use of these programs requires proficiency in Linux, C and PV-Wave (separate license required) programming languages and bash scripts. A GCC compiler is invoked with the make file in each C code program directory. Winplot is the general-purpose plotting utility. A Developers Guide provides specifics on the hardware and software requirements needed to execute the tool.
