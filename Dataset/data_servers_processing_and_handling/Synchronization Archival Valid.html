Save is a high-availability framework that manages IP addresses shared between multiple servers. It also monitors the health of those servers to determine which one should be actively servicing requests at any given time. Synchronization mechanisms allow configuration files to be kept consistent between systems and also allow commands to be executed across all servers of a particular type. Archival mechanisms provide automatic version control of configuration files to aid in recovery in case of errant configuration.
