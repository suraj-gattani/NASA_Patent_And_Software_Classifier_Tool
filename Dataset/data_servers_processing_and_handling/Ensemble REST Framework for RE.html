REST-based web services are a great tool for connecting a diverse set of components together in a clean and simple fashion. Ensemble REST makes it easy for developers to write and deploy RESTful web applications, and the HTTP protocol enables anyone to access and utilize the exposed services. There are libraries available in almost every programming language in order to connect a program in the language to an HTTP service.
