Developed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC), the Kameleon Software Suite addresses the difficulty in analyzing and disseminating the varying output formats of space weather model data. Employing a comprehensive standardization methodology, Kameleon allows heterogeneous model output to be stored uniformly in a common science data format. The converted files contain both the original model output as well as additional metadata elements to create platform-independent and self-descriptive data files. Kameleon facilitates model data dissemination, data reuse, and code reuse.
