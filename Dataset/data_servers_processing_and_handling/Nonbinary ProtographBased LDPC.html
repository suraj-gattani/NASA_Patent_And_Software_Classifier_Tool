The design method for short blocks is based on ensuring a large enough girth and a suitable edge label assignment to achieve a good code minimum distance. Here, for a given protograph, we obtain a derived graph by copy-and permute operations using the circulant PEG algorithm such that the girth is as large as possible. The selection of the original protograph is guided by our EXIT analysis: we start with a protograph having a competitive threshold at the prescribed alphabet size. After lifting the protograph to a desired size to obtain a large girth, we compute the cycle distribution of the graph to select the best one among the resulting graph candidates. The assignment of the non-binary labels from a given field GF(q ) is selective rather than random. We select the labels so that the binary image of the check node with the assigned labels produces the largest possible minimum Hamming distance for that check node. For each q , we generate all possible label sets that produce the largest minimum distance for the binary images of the checks with associated labels. Moreover we proposed a modified cycle cancelation method that, in addition to the shortest cycles, it eliminates other cycles as well.
