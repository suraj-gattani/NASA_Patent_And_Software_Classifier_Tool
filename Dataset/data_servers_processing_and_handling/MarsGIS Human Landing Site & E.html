The innovation includes a GIS (Geographical Information System) layer and a web-based GIS service. The GIS layer includes the geospatial location and spatial extent of the Exploration Zones(EZs), regions of interest (ROIs), and data characterizing the science and resources purported to be available. These data were extracted from publicly-available abstracts and presentations to the HLS2 EZ Workshop in October 2015 as proposals for the first human landing site on Mars. The web-based service allows users to view and analyze this layer; verify, alter, and annotate the layers data, add/edit/delete new EZs, and will support users collaboration on these data. The layer was developed under the auspices of a SACD investment fund opportunity, through the labors of five students. The NASA civil servant defined requirements for, and students used ESRI ArcGIS to draw the EZs and ROIs; and associated each EZ and ROI with tabulated data from authors papers. The GIS tool was developed by the inventors listed in this disclosure, and coded by students and the STARSS III contractor (under auspices of SACD investment fund and Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC)) based on the ESRI ArcGIS platform and available widgets and tools, through NASAs enterprise agreement with ESRI.
