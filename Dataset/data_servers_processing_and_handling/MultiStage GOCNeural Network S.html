A multi-stage automated target recognition (ATR) system has been designed to perform computer vision tasks with adequate proficiency in mimicking human vision. The system is able to detect, identify, and track targets of interest. A feed forward back propagation neural network (NN) is then trained to classify each feature vector and remove false positives. The system parameter optimizations process has been developed to adapt to various targets and datasets.
