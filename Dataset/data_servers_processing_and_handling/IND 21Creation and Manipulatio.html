Decision trees are commonly used in artificial intelligence and statistical pattern recognition. A tree is "grown" from data using a recursive-partitioning algorithm. IND re-implements parts of existing standard prediction algorithms, offers experimental control suites, and also introduces new, more sophisticated methods for growing decision trees.
