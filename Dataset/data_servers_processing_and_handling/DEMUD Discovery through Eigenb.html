We have developed a machine learning solution called DEMUD (Discovery through Eigenbasis Modeling of Uninteresting Data). DEMUD works by building a model U of the uninteresting class and then identifying items that are maximally anomalous (and therefore likely to be interesting) with respect to that model.
