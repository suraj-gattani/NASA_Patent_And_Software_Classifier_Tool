This stand-alone application is named 'RouterAgent'. We have currently realized a fully functional (version-1) implementation for Windows operating system and for CISCO routers; this version is already deployed in real world at APL and DISA test sites. We are in the process of realizing the same for Unix/Linux operating systems, Juniper routers, as well as, adding more advanced automation features to the realized products.
