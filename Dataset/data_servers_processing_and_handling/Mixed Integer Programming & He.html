We introduce mixed integer programming and heuristic scheduling for space communication networks in this paper. The considered communication network consists of space and ground assets with the link dynamics between any two assets vary with respect to time, distance, and telecom configurations. One asset could be communicating with another at very high data rates at one time and at other times, communication is impossible, as the asset could be inaccessible from the network due to planetary occultation. Based on the networks geometric dynamics and link capabilities, the start time, end time, and link configuration of each view-period are selected to maximize the communication efficiency within the network. The Mars Relay Network Planning Tool (MRNPT) was developed in 2003 at Jet Propulsion Laboratory with the goal of finding an optimal schedule for communication between different orbiters and surface assets at Mars and the Deep Space Network (DSN) ground stations.
