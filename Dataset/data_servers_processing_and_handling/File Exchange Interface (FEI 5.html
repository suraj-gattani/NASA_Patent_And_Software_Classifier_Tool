The File Exchange Interface (FEI) service offers secure file transaction, storage, transportation, and management services. The tool is implemented with the latest Java technologies for maximum portability and supports a 64-bit file system for very large file transfers over secure socket connections. While database-driven for file transactions and user access management, FEI offers an interactive client software suite for managing administration and general use.
