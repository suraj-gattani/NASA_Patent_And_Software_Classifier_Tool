The software supports the modulations of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature PSK (QPSK), 8-PSK, 16 amplitude PSK (16-APSK), and 32-APSK. For each modulation type, the software modulator support for various bit-to-modulation-symbol mappings, including the natural order, the Gray code, the anti-Gray code, and the ordering specified by the Digital Video Broadcast Satellite Second Generation standard for 16-APSK and 32-APSK. The software supports hard and soft demodulation, and when soft, it supports both an exact log likelihood computation and an approximate log likelihood computation based on nearest neighbors.
