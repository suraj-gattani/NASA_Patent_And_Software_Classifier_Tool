The User-friendly Metadata (UFM) tool functions as a filter. The tool accepts an ODL file as input and generates a simple HTML representation of the ODL as output. Command-line options provide a user with the ability to modify the program's functionality. Please visit: http://opensource.gsfc.nasa.gov/projects/UFM/index.php
