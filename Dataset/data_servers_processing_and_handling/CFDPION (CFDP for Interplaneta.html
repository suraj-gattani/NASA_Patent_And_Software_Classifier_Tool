CFDP-ION is an implementation of CFDP that uses ION's DTN implementation as its UT layer. The Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) communication system is an implementation of Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols for space flight operations. It enables reliable automatic data communication over a network of arbitrarily complex topology comprising both deep-space links and more Internet-like connections. CFDP-ION includes implementations of the optional Proxy and Remote Directory Listing interoperable user operations defined in the CFDP standard. CFDP-ION utilizes the Interplanetary Communication Infrastructure (ICI) application interface offered by ION to invoke any operating system functionality that is not common to all POSIX-compliant operating systems. This enables CFDP-ION to be used without modification in VxWorks 5.4, Solaris 9, OS/X, and various Linux distributions.
