EDGE uses Apache Solr for fast indexed search backend. Inventory data stored in PO.DAAC's Oracle server is being incrementally indexed avery 15 minutes. Apache Solr provides optimal search solution to all data it managements. By offloading data from Oracle, this eliminates Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against the core data management backend. To further ensure reliable serving of data, EDGE's Apache Solr uses Master and Slave model. The Master instance is for data indexing.
