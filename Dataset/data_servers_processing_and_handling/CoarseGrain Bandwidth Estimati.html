We developed two version of the leveling schemes: a) a straight-forward version which simply spreads the data of each data type across the time horizon and does not take into account the interactions among data types within a pass nor between data types across overlapping passes at a network node, and is inherently sub-optimal. b) 2-State Markov leveling scheme that takes into account the second order behavior of the store-and-forward mechanism, the interactions among data types within a pass.
