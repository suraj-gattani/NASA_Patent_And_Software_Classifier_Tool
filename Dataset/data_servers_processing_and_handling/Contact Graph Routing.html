This software was developed to support the NASA DTN Technology Readiness program. The Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) communication system is an implementation of Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols for space flight operations. It enables reliable automatic data communication over a network of arbitrarily complex topology comprising both deep-space links and more Internet-like connections.
