The RF4425 takes an S-band RF signal and converts it to an RS-422 differential baseband signal. The SyncLink samples the raw data stream and imports it over USB into Linux. From here custom C functions can be written to analyze the data such as frame synchronization and file export, bit-error rate checking, etc.
