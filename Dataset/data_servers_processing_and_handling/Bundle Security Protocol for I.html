The Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) communication system is an implementation of Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols for space flight operations. It enables reliable automatic data communication over a network of arbitrarily complex topology comprising both deep-space links and more Internet-like connections. The bundle protocol is used in DTNs which overlay multiple networks, some of which may be challenged by limitations such as intermittent and possibly unpredictable loss of connectivity, long or variable delay, asymmetric data rates, and high error rates. The purpose of the bundle protocol is to support interoperability across such stressed networks.
