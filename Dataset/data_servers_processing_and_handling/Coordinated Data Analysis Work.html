The CDAWeb software and the CDAWeb service built on this software have been developed and continue to be enhanced and maintained by the Space Physics Data Facility. The technology has supported NASA/Office of Space Science programs dealing with the connections between the Sun and the Earth. CDAWeb software is essentially a set of Interactive Data Language (IDL) scripts that act as the engine of the system. Please visit: http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/cdaweb/istp_public/
