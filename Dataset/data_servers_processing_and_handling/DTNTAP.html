DTNTAP is a userspace Ethernet driver with the potential to expedite DTN deployment by providing a transition mechanism for legacy IP (Internet Protocol) applications to run alongside delay and disruption tolerant applications in large scale communication networks. By presenting an Ethernet-like interface, DTNTAP gives application developers access to many of the benefits of DTN without having to become immediately proficient at a new programming API.
