Defines a device driver that runs using the POSIX real-time operating system package to provide a FPGA interface to the S-Band hardware for the CoNNeCT experiment. Instead of interacting with hardware devices directly using direct-memory mapped access at the application level, this driver provides an API offering easy to use standard POSIX function calls. This simplifies application programming as well as offering an additional level of protection to the hardware and portability.
