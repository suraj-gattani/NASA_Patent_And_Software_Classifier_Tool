The Simple Subset Wizard (SSW) makes searching for granules easier. The tool unites the search function with various subsetters to deliver a single, simple, seamless process. SSW uses OpenSearch to query the Earth Observing System Clearing House (ECHO) for granules and then employs individual subset agents to submit requests. The SSW currently has 11 agents to interface with different subsetters, which support the subsetting of 217 EOSDIS data sets. The SSW provides the capability to subset by either temporal range or spatial region, although not all subsetters have both of these capabilities.
