Simple, Scalable, Script-based, Science Processing (S4P) Archive (S4PA) is a disk-based archiving system for remote sensing data. The tool can be used for new data transfer, data preprocessing, metadata generation, and data archival. Services provided include data access control, data subscription, metadata publication, and data recovery. All data are archived on readily available disk drives, with FTP and HTTP being the primary modes of data access. S4PA includes a graphical user interface for monitoring and re-configuring system operation. Please visit: http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/additional/techlab/s4pa
