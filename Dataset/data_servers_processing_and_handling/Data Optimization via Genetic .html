OCO-2 will be based on the previously launched Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) satellite and will carry a single instrument, consisting of three high-resolution grating spectrometers (instruments that measure properties of light within the electromagnetic spectrum). This instrument will obtain the most precise measurements of atmospheric CO2 ever made from space. The spacecraft, developed by Orbital Sciences Corp., will be based upon the LeoStar-2 architecture, which was also used on the successful Earth orbiting SORCE and GALEX missions. OCO-2 will fly in a near- polar orbit, thus enabling it to observe most of the Earth's surface at least once every sixteen days.
