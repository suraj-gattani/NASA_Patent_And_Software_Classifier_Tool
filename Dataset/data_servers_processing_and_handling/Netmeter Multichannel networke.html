This software is used for Precision Deployable Apertures and Structures project, demonstrating the technology for AMD. It will likely be reused in GSE for AMD. We've also used it to measure piezoelectric actuators for the PICTURE sounding rocket experiment. Netmeter reads the outputs of several phasemeters, and either displays it on the screen, saves it to disk, or provides data to a graphical interface (LabView or Web) over the lab network. The built-in web server allows remote operation without neeting a separate server.
