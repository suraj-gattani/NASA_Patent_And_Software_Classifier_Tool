A set of libraries used in the development of software applications. libSPRITE was specifically designed for real-time systems that operate on a single computational node (but may be multi-core) to systematically address common coding errors, provide for multi-threaded programming to produce the exact same results regardless of the number of cores on the host compute node, and offer support for in-operation reconfigurability (parameter and control flow modifications). Components include engineering unit encoders, math functions, a task scheduler built on top of pthreads, a publish/subscribe data distribution system, and a Lua scripting language interface.
