Dyper protects a site from unauthorized network flows. The tool offers dynamic perimeter enforcement by providing a general-purpose mechanism for maintaining least-privilege network security policies while still supporting the full utilization of multiport protocols. Dyper requires no changes to software or practices outside of the perimeter and only minimal changes inside.
