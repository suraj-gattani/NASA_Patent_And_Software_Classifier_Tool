This tool is used in opperations by the MRO and Phoenix missions. The tool provides both time savings and risk reduction in the periodic updating of the dsn_config modeling adaptation. The dsn config converter tool is used for converting the dsn_config.cvs file into a multi-mission AAF file for use by the multi-mssion autogen/apgen sequence generation tool.
