The EEPROM File System (EEFS) is a simple, reliable file system for embedded systems. The primary purpose of the EEFS is to provide a file system abstraction for EEPROM or PROM memories that is simple, efficient, and can be proven to be reliable. The EEFS can be used on embedded systems where a file system is needed to access data from EEPROM, PROM, or RAM memory, but otherwise might not have the resources to deploy a full file system such as the MSDOS file system. The EEPROM file system can also be used in systems where the ability to dump, patch, and diagnose files is required.
