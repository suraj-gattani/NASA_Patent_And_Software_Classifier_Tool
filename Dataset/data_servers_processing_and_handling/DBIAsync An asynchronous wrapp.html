Provides a simple asynchronous API wrapping the existing Perl 6 DBIish Database interaction module. It manages a pool of database handles allocated as needed to perform database queries in a thread-safe manner. It can utilize promises to queue queries that will be performed asynchronously when a database handle becomes available. It also handles retries gracefully on database connection failures allowing the primary application to continue even when the database goes down and is restarted.
