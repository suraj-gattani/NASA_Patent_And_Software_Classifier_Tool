JavaGenes-Scheduler is a general purpose evolutionary system designed to compare techniques for scheduling observations. It was originally developed for scheduling observations made by Earth-observing satellites. JavaGenes-Scheduler uses a simple, earliest-first scheduler to insert observations into the timeline in permutation order.
