JPL has provided the underlying infrastructure to share data increasing the study power associated with capturing and comparing information. The infrastructure provides software services including data processing and management (eCAS), biomarker data management (BMDB), specimen data management (ERNE), and a portal to link the system together and provide access. These are software built on top of the Apache OODT software services.
