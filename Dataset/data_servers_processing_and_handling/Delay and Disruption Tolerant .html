This software models the Delay Tolerant Networking - Licklider Transmision Protocol for JPL's MACHETE (Multimission Advanced Communications Hybrid Environment for Test and Evaluation). The Multi-mission Advanced Communications Hybrid Environment for Test and Evaluation (MACHETE) has been developed at JPL for the purpose of determining the performance of existing and emerging communications protocols and services in the context of space exploration. This protocol model can assist NASA network designers who wish to use Delay Tolerant Networking protocols.
