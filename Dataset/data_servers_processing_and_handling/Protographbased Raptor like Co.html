In many applications such as hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), rate-compatible family in the usual sense must have the same information block size, otherwise it is not useful for such applications. The proposed codes have this property. The Raptor code is proposed previously and appeared in the literature in the context of an unstructured irregular LDPC code in concatenation with the Luby Transform (LT) code. The code was designed for long block size.
