Micro-displays are tools for mental model re-alignment, helping operators to keep their mental models of how the system works and behaves aligned with the changing state of the complex system. Data-driven micro-displays such as the Postage Stamp and Mini-Stamp display information about the system in a consistent way. Like a traffic light, the format of the micro-display never changes: the operator always knows where to look to find a specific piece of information. The Mini-Stamp always looks like the Mini-Stamp, and all of its data fields always lie in the same place on the micro-display. Real-time data flows through the Mini-Stamp to provide information to the operator.
