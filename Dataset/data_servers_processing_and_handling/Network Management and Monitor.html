The Innovation is a software product that allows a user to manage and monitor a challenged network of remote nodes. The software provides users with information regarding the status of nodes, and users are able to send requests to the nodes and receive data back in response. The software provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to allow creation of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to provide a user with graphical views of incoming data as well as commanding functionality.
