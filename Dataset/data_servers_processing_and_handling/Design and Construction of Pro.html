We computed the threshold over the joint graph between the LDPC decoder and trellis nodes, which represent finite state partial response channels. At the receiver, we discussed two cases: (1) iteratively decode the big graph, namely BCJR-full; (2) only iterative LDPC graphs after taking outputs from the BCJR equalizer, namely BCJR-once. In this NTR, we computed decoding thresholds and simulated the code performance for both cases. We can also have different schedules of iterating between the BCJR equalizer and LDPC decoder such as to have one iteration for BCJR and then10 iterations for the LDPC decoder. Then we proceed again with one iteration for the BCJR iteration, then10 iterations for the LDPC decoder and so on to trade off the complexity and code performance. For the code simulation, instead of sending zero-codeword, we send a random codeword of a Co-set version of the protograph code. This random code acts like a zero-codeword in traditional linear code. We proposed a simple approach to search for a good protograph, which processes a low iterative decoding threshold in a partial response channel. We concentrated on graphs that possess good protograph properties of having a low decoding threshold and the linear minimum distance growth property that guarantees no error floor if random circulants are assigned when lifting the protograph. Such graphs should have degree-1 variable nodes, a fraction of high degree nodes, and degree-2 nodes.
