Models the Contact Graph Routing (CGR) system proposed for future NASA missions and used in DINET1 and DINET2 experiments. Create a simulation environment of Contact Graph Routing that uses the QualNet network simulator and leverage the previously-developed space communication models. This protocol model can assist NASA network designers who wish to use Delay Tolerant Networking protocols with Contact Graph Routing.
