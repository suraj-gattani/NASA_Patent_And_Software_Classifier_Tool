The Earth Observing System Clearing House (ECHO) affords the earth science community more flexibility in accessing and sharing data and services. As a metadata clearinghouse, ECHO supports iterative query data access. As a service broker, ECHO decentralizes data-manipulation tools and supports the interoperability of distributed functions.
