The Bundle Protocol (BP) is an international standard produced by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Standards (CCSDS). It is a key piece of the planned Interplanetary Internet. The basic idea is that BP is given bundles to deliver, and it delivers them to their specified destination, using the appropriate route. For example, the route might be from a Mars Rover to a Mars Orbiter to a Ground Station on Earth to a Mission Control Center. For each hop along the way, BP asks for assistance from the appropriate lower-level protocol. For example, to move bundles from a Ground Station to a Mission Control Center, it might use the Transmission Control Protocol (tcp). Generally, the lower-level protocol is responsible for providing reliable delivery across one hop, while BP manages the bigger picture (i.e. getting bundles across all the required hops). The Bundle Protocol Software Library implements the Bundle Protocol, using a software architecture that is simple and fast enough to be attractive to Goddard mission designers. It has been developed for the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) mission and the Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) group. It is useful for any organization (commercial or otherwise) that is interested in being part of the Interplanetary Internet.
