Working in real time and using very little memory and CPU, Performance Logging Services (PLS) is an innovative software-performance monitoring tool that tracks statistics on timing and buffer usage. To assist in troubleshooting, PLS will start or stop other software tools when performance requirements are out of specification. The technology has been used in the Checkout and Launch Control System on NASA's Space Shuttle program.
