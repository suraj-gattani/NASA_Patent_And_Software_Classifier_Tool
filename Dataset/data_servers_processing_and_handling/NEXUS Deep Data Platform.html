NEXUS provides a bridge between science data and horizontal-scaling data analysis. It provides a workflow to divide science artifacts into small data tiles to store in a cloud-scaled database where they can be quickly retrieved through a high performance spatial search registry. Through spatial index, NEXUS provides fast access to all relevant data tiles where each tile fits into RAM for fast in-memory computation.
