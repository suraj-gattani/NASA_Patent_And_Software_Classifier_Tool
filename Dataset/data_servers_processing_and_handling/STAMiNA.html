Utilizing STAMiNA, a simulation tool for the Advanced Sensors Collaborative Technology Alliance Microsensor Network Architecture, users can define: (1) mission environment, including terrain features; (2) a sensed object set, including multiple threat objects; (3) sensor placements, their modalities, and their abilities to sense different object types; (4) threat object trajectories; (5) sensing and sensed data dissemination for information fusion; and (6) various network configurations and formations between sensors to examine the coupling of sensing and communication. With these features, STAMiNA provides an overall system-level performance of different sensor network architectures under different parametric conditions.
