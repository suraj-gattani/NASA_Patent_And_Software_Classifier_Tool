This technology provides a framework to address the specific challenges for time-delayed operations, and geographically distributed collaborative monitoring and control. It enables you to build an effective architecture for integrating a heterogeneous collection of robotic assets into a common work.The goal is to allow operators from any NASA center to control any NASA lunar asset, regardless of location. This means that an operator may control the JPL ATHLETE robot locally (at JPL) or remotely (i.e. Johnson Space Center or remote field trial).
