The OSAL library isolates embedded application software from a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The technology provides a well-defined, generic interface to RTOS services; a generic interface to hardware services; and an implementation for several current RTO systems. By using the library, an embedded application can remain portable among multiple operating systems on multiple platforms.
