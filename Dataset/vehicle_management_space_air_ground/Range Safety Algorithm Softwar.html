This software library was developed to mitigate the public safety risks of hazards associated with the flight of expendable launch vehicles and other unmanned flight vehicles. The software encapsulates the various constructs and algorithms required to accomplish Time Space Position Information (TSPI) data management from multiple tracking sources. At its core, the technology evaluates various user-configurable rule sets that govern the qualification of TSPI data sources; provides a pre-launch autonomous hold-launch function; performs flight-monitoring/flight-termination functions; and provides end-of-mission safing.
