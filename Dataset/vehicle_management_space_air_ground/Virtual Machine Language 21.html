VML has been the command and sequence system for more than a dozen of JPL's past and current missions. As such, VML is a crucial element of JPL's suite of spaceflight capabilities. VML 2.1 advances this capability deeply into the realm of autonomy, becoming the structure and engine for the implementation of onboard autonomy. This it does by providing the network of decision-making and action-taking power needed to turn the knowledge of expert subsystems such as GN&C into specific mission-enabling events in space.
