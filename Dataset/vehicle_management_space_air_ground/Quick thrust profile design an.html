First, qSTAT executes the flight softwares attitude steering algorithm to determine the attitude command which follows the thrust direction profile in the TVF while keeping the arrays on sun (per the power steering logic). From the attitude command, qSTAT computes the attitude rate and angular accelerations required to follow the thrust profile, checking these against allowable limits. Next, qSTAT passes the commanded attitude and angular rate through a simplified closed-loop transfer function that models the low-bandwidth closed-loop dynamics of the spacecraft while under TVC control, producing an attitude estimate. This first portion of qSTAT meets the goal of being simple and quick, while also providing the level of accuracy necessary for evaluating the thrust profile itself.
