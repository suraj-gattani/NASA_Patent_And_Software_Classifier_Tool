The SGait algorithm uses the kinematic capability of ATHLETE's limbs to reposition wheels independently of the robot's payload deck while keeping them in contact with the ground. The wheel is rolled along the ground in coordination with limb repositioning. This can be done for individual wheels or groups of wheels, allowing the approximation of any 6-limbed walking gait. Between or during wheel repositioning motions, the payload deck is shifted to maintain a desired stable position above the wheels.
