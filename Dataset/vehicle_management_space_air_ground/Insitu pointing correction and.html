Due to mechanical backlash, calibration errors, and other sources, errors in camera pointing knowledge create geometric seams in image mosaics, where the individual images do not line up properly. For rover missions, motion of the rover in between frames can create additional seams. This software corrects these geometric seams as much as possible (some parallax seams are uncorrectable). This software provides one with the ability to understand in-situ mission image metadata that allows the pointing overlap to be determined in advance and the corrections automatically applied.
