AEGSE Virtuoso Charting enables animated real time charting of telemetry streams of data from the rover. The high performance application offers real-time telemetry monitoring through animated charts. These automatically scaled charts are completely interactive and allow users to choose the variables that they want to monitor. Furthermore, these charts were designed for extremely high performance, and they can process data from streams with many variables at such high frequencies as 100Hz.
