Given a model of noise in correlation matching between the left and right images of a stereo pair, we describe how to propagate that noise to the triangulated point using statistical means and how to make subsequent use of that calculation. First assume that the cameras have been mathematically corrected so that corresponding features lie on the same scanline of the left and right images. This is a technique known as image rectification and is standard in stereo vision processing.
