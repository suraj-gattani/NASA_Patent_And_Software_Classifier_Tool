The Constellation Visualization Tool (CVT) is a touchscreen interactive software tool, designed to model automated analyses of the Earth Observing System (EOS) Morning and Afternoon Constellations. These displays present data in a meaningful way through interactive visual displays that are intended to tell an interesting story, educate and inform users and the public about the missions NASA supports. Combining data presentation with user experience, user selected stories are brought to life, promoting awareness for NASA's mission of space exploration and scientific discovery.
