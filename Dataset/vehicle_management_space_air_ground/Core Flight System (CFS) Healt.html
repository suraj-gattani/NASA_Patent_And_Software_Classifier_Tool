The plug-and-play CFS Health and Safety application is compatible with the Core Flight Executive (cFE) and uses the Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL), both of which were developed by Goddard Space Flight Center in order to provide a reusable, platform-independent, mission-independent, layered architecture for hosting applications. The technology can be used for any government or commercial spacecraft. Please visit the following URL for additional information: http://sourceforge.net/projects/coreflightexec/files/cFE-6.1.1/
