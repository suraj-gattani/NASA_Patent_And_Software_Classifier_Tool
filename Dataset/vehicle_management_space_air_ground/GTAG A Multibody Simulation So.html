Any future small body mission will benefit from using this software. Indeed the software has already been extensively used. This software tool is used for the multi-body simulation of a spacecraft with a robotic arm and a sampling mechanism, which performs a touch-and-go (TAG) maneuver for sampling from the surface of a small celestial body. G-TAG utilizes G-DYN, a multi-body simulation engine, and interfaces to controllers, estimators, and environmental forces that affect the spacecraft. G-TAG can easily be adapted for the analysis of stress cases to assist the design of a TAG system as well as for comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulations to analyze a particular TAG system.
