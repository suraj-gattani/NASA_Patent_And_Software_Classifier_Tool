"Simulation of Cryogenic Tank with Temperature Stratification" is a MATLAB-based simulation of temperature stratification effects for cryogenic fluid in a tank. It is a reduced dynamical model describing temperature stratification effects driven by natural convection in a liquid hydrogen cryogenic tank. It accounts for storage, loading, and unloading of cryogenic fluid.
