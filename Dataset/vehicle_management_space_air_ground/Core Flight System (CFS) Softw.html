The SBN serves as a plug-in to the cFE framework to transfer messages across process/processor interfaces. The technology has three primary functions: to establish and maintain a connection to each peer over available process/processor interfaces; to distribute and maintain a subscription message database for each peer; and to distribute messages to peers that have subscribed to message identifiers.
