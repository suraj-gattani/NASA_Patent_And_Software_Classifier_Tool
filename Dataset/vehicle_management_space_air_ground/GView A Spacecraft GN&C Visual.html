A newly developed 3-D software visualization tool for supporting spacecraft GN&C simulations relevant to small body exploration and sampling. The software is developed in Matlab and provides users with the ability to visualize the behavior of their simulations, regardless of whichprogramming language (or machine), is used to generate simulation results. The only requirement is that multibody simulation data is generated and placed in the proper format before applying G-View.
