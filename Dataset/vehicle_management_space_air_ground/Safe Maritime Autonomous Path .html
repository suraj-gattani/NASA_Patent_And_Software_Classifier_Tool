We use response amplitude operators (RAOs) to find a set of speeds and headings that results in excessive pitch and roll oscillations. A RAO is essentially a Bode plot that describes the frequency response of each of the six ship motions (i.e., roll, pitch, yaw, heave, sway, and surge) to a sea state (i.e., wave spectrum). RAO is obtained from a linearized model of ship motions of a specific vessel hull shape at a specific speed and wave heading. Commercial software is available to compute RAOs based on computational fluid dynamics.
