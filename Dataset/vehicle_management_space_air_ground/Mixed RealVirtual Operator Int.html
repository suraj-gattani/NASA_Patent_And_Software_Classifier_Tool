The mixed real/virtual operator interface for ATHLETE (MSim-ATHLETE) is a new operator interface system for inspection and manipulation motions of JPL's 36-joint ATHLETE (All-Terrain Hex-Legged Extra-Terrestrial Explorer) based on the idea of allowing the operator to extend the robot's actual kinematics with virtual links and joints.
