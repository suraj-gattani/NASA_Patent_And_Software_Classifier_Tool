The PDG (Powered Descent Guidance) algorithm and software for computing Mars pinpoint or precision landing guidance was enhanced with options to constrain the maximum allowable speed and the allowable attitude profiles. The speed constraints were added as an option to ensure that velocity profiles could be limited from speeds that would produce excessive drag or approach the speed of sound. The attitude constraints were added as an option to ensure that attitude profiles would avoid downward thrust (i.e., avoid thrusting the spacecraft downward toward the surface).
