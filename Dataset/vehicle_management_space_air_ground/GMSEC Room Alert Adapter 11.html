The Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) Room Alert Adatper (RAA) 1.1 is the most recent and updated version to the interface between GMSEC compliant components and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Environment Monitoring devices (AVTECH Room Alert). In addition to providing environmental sensor data to GMSEC-compliant components via a middleware-based architecture on a periodic basis, now GMSEC components can request sensor values on demand and receive the values in reply messages. The messages can be used by other components to notify operations personnel and automatically begin mitigation or recovery actions in the event of a degraded environment for the computers that support the Mission Operation Center (MOC).
