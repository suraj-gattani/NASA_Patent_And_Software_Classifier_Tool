The GNC covariance analysis tool (G-CAT) has been developed to support landing/descent/ascent/rendezvous applications in lunar, planetary, and small body missions. G-CAT characterizes on-board knowledge propagation errors associated with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) errors (gyro and accelerometer), gravity errors and dispersions (spherical harmonics, masscons), and radar errors (multiple altimeter beams, multiple Doppler velocimeter beams). G-CAT is a stand-alone Matlab-based tool intended to run on any engineer's desktop computer.
