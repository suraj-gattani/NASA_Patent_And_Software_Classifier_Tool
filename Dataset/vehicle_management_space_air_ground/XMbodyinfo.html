The software is very useful for streamlining the spacecraft tour design process.This software has already been successfully used on Cassini. It can also be used rather easily for other Cassini type missions such as the upcoming Europa mission. On Cassini many of hours were saved in the evaluation of the extended mission and extended-extended mission tours. The science optimization and overall science return increase as result of this software was tremendous but cannot be estimated precisely.
