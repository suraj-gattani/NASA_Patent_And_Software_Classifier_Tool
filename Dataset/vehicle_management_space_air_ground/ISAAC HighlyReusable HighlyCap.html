This 3-year effort will start at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 with a Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) FPGA-based breadboard Xilinx ML410 for developing key ISAAC components, and will then be followed with custom design and fabrication of the ISAAC engineering model board by retrofitting the existing FPGA-based ESMD MicroInspector avionics board with respect to the instrument control and computing specific requirement. This effort will culminate with the system-level radiation test of complete ISAAC technology that matures it to TRL 6. Success of this effort will result in a flight-ready product in the 2010-time-frame for infusion into SMAP/HYDROS, one of Decadal flight missions.
