Iris is an X-Band deep space transponder consisting of an exciter board (26 dBm output at X-Band), a receiver board (-120 dBm sensitivity), a power supply board, two antenna boards featuring four patch antennas (a transmit and receive in each of two directions), and a Marina-2 board for digital signal processing on a Virtex V FPGA. The design for INSPIRE features PC104 board interfacing and stacking in the Pumpkin CubeSat style.
