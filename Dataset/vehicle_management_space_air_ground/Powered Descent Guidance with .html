The PDG (Powered Descent Guidance) algorithm and software for generating Mars pinpoint or precision landing guidance profiles has been enhanced to incorporate thrust pointing constraints, a significant theoretical contribution. Pointing constraints would typically be needed for onboard sensor and navigation systems that have specific field-of-view requirements to generate valid ground proximity and terrain-relative state measurements.
