The programs use data from gridded meteorological analyses (including, currently, GEOS-5/MERRA and NCEP/GFS, but designed to easily adapt to others) to identify the locations and characteristics (windspeed, temperature, wind components, potential vorticity, equivalent latitude, potential temperature, relative vorticity, and other fields) at the jet maximum and the edges of the jet regions. It also compiles detailed tropopause information based on several commonly used definitions of the tropopause, including cataloging times/locations with multiple tropopauses.
