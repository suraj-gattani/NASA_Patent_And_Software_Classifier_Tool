The BAT engineering software controls and coordinates all aspects of the instrument's operation in nominal and anomalous conditions. It distributes commands to, and collects data from, all instrument subsystems, including the power system, the 16 detector blocks, the digital signal processor, and the science data processing software. The technology also communicates with the Swift spacecraft to receive commands from the ground and send all instrument telemetry data. In addition, the software monitors the health of various instrument subsystems and takes corrective actions when necessary.
