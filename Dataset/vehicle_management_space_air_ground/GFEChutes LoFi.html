The GFE Lo-Fi Chutes Model provides basic modeling capability of a sequential series of parachute activities. Actions include deploying the parachute, changing the reefing on the parachute, and cutting away the parachute. Multiple chutes can be deployed at any given time, but all chutes in that case are assumed to behave as individually isolated chutes; there is no modeling of any interactions between deployed chutes. Drag characteristics of a deployed chute are based on a coefficient of drag, the face-area of the chute, and the local dynamic pressure only. The orientation of the chute is approximately modeled for purposes of obtaining torques on the vehicle, but the dynamic state of the chute as a separate entity is not integrated, the treatment is simply an approximation. Plans for every post-shuttle manned vehicle which will reenter Earth's atmosphere, or for that matter, the Martian atmosphere, include a descent phase controlled by some sort of parachute system. Having a NASA-certified parachute model which can be plugged into various flight simulators is a huge advantage. Building a special purpose parachute simulator for a specific simulation is at least a million dollar job. Lockheed Martin had to do exactly that in order to support Pad Abort I, and GFEChutes Lo-Fi was tested against the Lockheed prototype. Having a verified, Class C parachute model, packaged in a reusable (plug-and-play) form, is smart technically and an outstanding strategic move as we enter the world of commercial manned space flight.
