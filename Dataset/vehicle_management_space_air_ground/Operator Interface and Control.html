The "Operator Interface and Control Software for the Reconfigurable Surface System Tri-ATHLETE" is a full 3D interactive kinematic simulator that enables the configuration and reconfiguration of modular robotic systems. Modular robotics will enable new classes of exploration missions for NASA and this research is a step towards making them more operable.
