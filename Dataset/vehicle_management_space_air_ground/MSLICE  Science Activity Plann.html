MSLICE has been tasked to fulfill a challenging set of requirements. To meet these requirements, MSLICE delivers a rich feature set which includes but is not limited to: 1) Simple, intuitive, and powerful search capability. For any given mission there is a huge amount of data and associated metadata that is generated. Quickly and easily sifting through all the data to find the interesting products requires a powerful tool with an intuitive interface. MSLICE provides such an interface in much the same way that the major Internet search engines provide a tool for searching the internet. 2) Visualization of the rover's traverse in a HiRISE image. This view is basically a map of the mission, and it allows scientists to easily gauge where the rover has been and where they would like it to go. The map also provides the ability to correct or adjust the known position of the rover through the technique of overlaying images acquired from the rover on top of the HiRISE image. A user can then correct the rover's position by collocating the visible features in the overlays with the same features in the underlying HiRISE image. 3) Visualization of data products and the ability to view mosaics.
