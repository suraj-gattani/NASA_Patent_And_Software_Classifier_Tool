This software is written in fortran and Perl. A set of input files define the desired image swath or flight plan, the radar constraints, flight parameters, and any ground targets that will be imaged. The image swath or flight plan may be defined by either the image swath length, heading, and center coordinate, the flight path endpoints, or the image swath endpoints. The radar contraints define such things as the max and min PRF, data window length, data window position, pulse repetition interval, data rate, duty cycle, etc.
