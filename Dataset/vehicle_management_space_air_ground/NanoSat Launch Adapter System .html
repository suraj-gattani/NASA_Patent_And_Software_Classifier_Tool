NLAS maximizes the efficiency of satellite launch opportunities. The technology acts as a "spacer" between the rocket and the primary spacecraft. NLAS consists of three main subsystems: the Adapter, the Dispenser, and the Deployment Sequencer. Each subsystem can be configured to meet the specific needs of a given launch.
