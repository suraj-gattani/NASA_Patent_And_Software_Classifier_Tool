An update to software originally named DAVEtools 0.5, this software-based technology is used for manipulating standard Dynamic Aerospace Vehicle Exchange Markup Language (DAVE-ML) models. The improved technology embeds the necessary initialization data into a data structure to keep the MATLAB workspace uncluttered and creates Simulink models from a generated MATLAB script.
