METRIC model software can be used to calculate evapotranspiration (ET) rates of agricultural fields by executing the Measuring Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model in an ArcGIS Python script. The model requires input data from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and local weather stations. The creation of this software was motivated by the need to reduce irrigation costs for farmers and provide a means of drought monitoring for the agricultural industry. This software has the potential to reduce the economic stress on the agricultural industry by enhancing crop productivity and irrigation efficiency.
