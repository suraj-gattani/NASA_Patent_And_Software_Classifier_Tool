The Kepler mission observed approximately 200,000 stars for four years and identified over 34,000 transit-like events. The Kepler Robovetter translates the logic used to discriminate between "likely planet candidates" and "false positives" and automates the evaluation of large Kepler data sets which are available at the public archive. The expected audience is active astronomers in the scientific community. NASA acknowledges the SETI Institutes primary role in authoring and producing the Kepler Robovetter under Cooperative Agreement Number NNX13AD01A.
