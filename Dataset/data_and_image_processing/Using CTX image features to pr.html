Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features are used to model the texture in CTX images. Local image intensity statistics are also extracted from the CTX images. The geomorphology of the underlying terrain is also taken into account by using the geomorphic maps produced by geologists during the landing site selection process. The statistical relationship between CTX image features, geomorphology and rock density is learned by incorporating HiRISE rock counts and a geomorphic map covering the Phoenix landing site as ground truth.
