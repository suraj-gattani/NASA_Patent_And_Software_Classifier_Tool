Beginning in 1998, a drought in the Southwestern United States caused water levels in Lake Mead to fall to historic lows and uncover thousands of acres of lakebed sediment along the shoreline. This software quantifies and visualizes the decreasing water levels and land cover changes in the Lower Grand Canyon. The software provides images, statistics, and graphs to understand these changes.
