NASA atmospheric and Earth science missions generate vast amounts of data every day. Clustering algorithms are used in various applications including pattern recognition, classification, data compression, regression, and related optimization problems. The design implements a computational solution for an autonomous data-reduction/clustering process to produce a representative distribution and joint relationships of the data without assuming a specific type of distribution and relationship nor resorting to domain-specific knowledge about the data.
