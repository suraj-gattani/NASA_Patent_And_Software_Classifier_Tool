The primary purpose of the Level 2 retrieval software is to derive estimates of the column averaged atmospheric CO2 dry air mole fraction, XCO2, and other Level 2 data products from the spectra returned by the OCO-2 mission. Where XCO2 is defined as the ratio of the column abundances of CO2 and the column abundance of dry air.
