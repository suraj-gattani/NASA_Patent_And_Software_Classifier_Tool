JPL led the production of official machine-readable artifacts for several cycles of the official task forces that develop the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Systems Modeling Language (SysML) specification standards published by the Object Management Group (OMG). The technology in this NTR focuses on capturing JPL's experience into extensions of various tools for replacing labor-intensive manual workflows typically involved in standards development at the OMG with automated workflow processes.
