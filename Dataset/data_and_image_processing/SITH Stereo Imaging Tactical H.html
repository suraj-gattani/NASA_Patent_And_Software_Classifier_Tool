SITH was also the only available program to display the color stereo images that were produced for Phoenix. It is expected that SITH will be used even more for MSL, and future stereo-based missions. As image pipeline parameters are tuned before the mission to balance correlation performance vs. accuracy, a tool such as this will be invaluable.
