TestEVAL was generated to provide a tool for processing and plotting mechanical test data. This tool is used for both handling pre-test planning and post test processing. The tool provides plotting capability for different data formats, including Nastran xyplot punch files, Excel files, CSV files, Matlab files, and network communication via pipes. The data can plotted in linear, log or semi-log scales. Data can be modified and processed against other data sets to assist in understanding the test responses or predictions.
