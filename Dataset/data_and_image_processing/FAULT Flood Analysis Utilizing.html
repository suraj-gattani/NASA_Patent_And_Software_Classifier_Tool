During this project, an automated script was generated that performs high-level flood analysis to relieve work load for end-users. The script incorporated Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) tiles and utilized computer-learning techniques to generate accurate water extent maps. The script referenced the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land-water mask, to isolate areas of flood induced waters. These areas were overlaid onto the National Land Cover Databases (NLCD) land cover data, the Oak Ridge National Laboratorys LandScan data, and Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) to determine the classification of areas impacted and the population density affected by flooding.
