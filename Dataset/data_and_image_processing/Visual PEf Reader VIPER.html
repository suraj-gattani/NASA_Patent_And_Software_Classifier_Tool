With the PEF Viewer, we intend to make it easy and fast to find and graphically display pertinent information for the sequence. The front-end of the tool contains much of the aesthetically appeasing material for viewing. The timestamp is displayed in the top left corner and highlighted details displayed in the bottom left corner. The time bar stretches along the top of the window and the rest of the space is allotted for blocks and step-functions. A preferences window is used to control the layout of the sections along with the ability to choose color and size of the blocks.
