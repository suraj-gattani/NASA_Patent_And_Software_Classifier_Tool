This instrument can be used for surveying of planetary landscapes by spectral imaging. It can also be used for battlefield surveillance and spectral imaging of live tissues for disease detection. CTIS (Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer) is a novel instrument that enables transient-level multi-spectral imaging by capturing spatial and spectral information in a single snapshot.
