IMS software utilizes techniques from the fields of model-based reasoning, machine learning, and data mining to build system monitoring knowledge bases from archived or simulated sensor data. The technology automatically analyzes the nominal system data to form general classes of expected system sensor values; these classes are used to build a monitoring knowledge base. When monitoring a system, IMS simply checks to see how well the incoming sensor data fit into the classes derived from the training data.
