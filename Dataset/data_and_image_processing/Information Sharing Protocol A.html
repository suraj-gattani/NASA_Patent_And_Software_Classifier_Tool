ISPATOM is a generic computational software program (comps). Most comps that are run in the NASA Mission Control Center (MCC) must be defined and hard-coded into C or some other programming language. ISPATOM runs on the MCC Linux workstations and can run any computations that can be represented as a mathematical equation without prior configuration. An equation or several equations are simply entered on the command line, the values are calculated, the computed values are saved in output symbols, and the output symbols are published.
