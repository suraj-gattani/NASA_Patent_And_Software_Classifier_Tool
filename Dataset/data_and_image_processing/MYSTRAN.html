MYSTRAN is a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) processor. MYSTRAN takes NASTRAN data decks as input and processes them to generate results files based on the inputs. NASTRAN was originally developed at NASA GSFC in the 1960's. The input files describe the mechanical nature of some piece of hardware and the loads or driving inputs that cause some reaction. With this input MYSTRAN computes the responses to the driving inputs. The theory and research for FEA analysis has been developed over decades.
