The V-FASTR candidate classifier computes ten features to describe each candidate and generate a predicted class. It employs a trained random forest classifier to predict the class for each new candidate ("pulse", "artifact", or "none), then consults a database of known pulsars to further refine its predictions. If a candidate classified as "pulse" matches a known pulsar (in location on the sky and dispersion measure), it is re-classified as "pulsar." If there is no known match for a "pulse", it is re-classified as "good candidate" since it may indicate the discovery of a new pulsar or other unknown phenomena. Predictions that are sufficiently confident are added to the meta-data associated with the candidate and used to reduce the number of candidates that require human review
