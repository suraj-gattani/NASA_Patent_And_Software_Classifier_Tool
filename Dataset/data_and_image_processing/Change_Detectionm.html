This software greatly automates the process allowing rapid detection of changes. Recently, evidence of water induced changes to the martian surface were observed by a frame-toframe change detection technique. This software could perform the same task at a much quicker rate allowing for more data to be analyzed. This software can identify changes in satellite imaging over time for NASA Earth-Orbiting Satellites as well planetary exploration mission. The software tool described in this document is used to detect changes in an image by comparing the the image to a static background estimation.
