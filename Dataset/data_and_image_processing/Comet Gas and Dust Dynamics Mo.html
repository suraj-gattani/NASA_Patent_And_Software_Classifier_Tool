This tool is used to perform the scientific analysis of the MIRO measurements and to study the evolution of the comet coma. The scientific analysis contributes to one of NASAs research objectives: Learn how the Suns family of planets and minor bodies originated and evolved. A lightweight, un-cooled dual-frequency heterodyne radiometer has been developed for the European Space Agency (ESA) Rosetta mission to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with encounters at Earth, Mars, and two asteroid (2867) Steins and (21) Lutetia.
