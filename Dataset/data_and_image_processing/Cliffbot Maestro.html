The Maestro application is a rover operations application that uses the data products from Orchestrator to give an operator context in which to command Cliffbot. The application user interface provides two sets of tools for operations: stereo image browsing and command generation. The stereo image browsing features let the operator see stereo images acquired from the Cliffbot cameras in 2D and 3D views to analyze the appearance and shape of the terrain in the vicinity of the rover.
