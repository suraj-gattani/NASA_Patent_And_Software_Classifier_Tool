GAIM is used to estimate the three-dimensional electron density distribution of the Earth's ionosphere as a function of time. To achieve high accuracy for users, the software accepts a wide variety of ionospheric measurements as input and produces output either in real time or in post-processing. The software can also generate predictions of the electron density structure for several hours or days into the future.
