This tool will continue to be used by the MRO project to support all relay activities with all NASA and non-NASA assets on the surface of Mars. At the time of writing, this includes Phoenix and the Mars Exploration Rovers; and will likely include Mars Surface Laboratory (2009) and the European ExoMars (expected 2013). This software utilizes an input file provided by the lander team, along with a managed configuration file, to run MRO's MTT software (described elsewhere) recursively to construct the Relay PTF.
