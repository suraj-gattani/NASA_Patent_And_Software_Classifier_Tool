The Data Processing Pipeline is a central element of the Kepler Ground Data System. The Science Processing Pipeline is used to analyze stellar photometric data from the Kepler spacecraft and report results to search for planets within the Kepler photometric dataset. The software data release is to allow the scientific community access to the details of the software algorithms within the Science Processing Pipeline. The pipeline performs pixel-level calibration, photometric analysis, systematic error correction, transiting planet detection, modeling and diagnostic testing of potential transit signatures, attitude determination, stellar target management, and monitoring of instrument health and performance.
