Operations engineers involved with the complicated task of planning, operating and maintain a spacecraft are inundated with large amounts of data. Structured, methodical processes for dealing with these data sets have proven to be effective yet time consuming. To quickly respond to problems an efficient overview of multiple systems may be needed at any time. Technology provides this information to engineers from the convenience of their mobile phone thereby increasing efficiency.
