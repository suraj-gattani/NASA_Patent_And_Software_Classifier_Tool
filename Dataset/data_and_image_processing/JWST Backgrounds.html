jwst_backgrounds is a a simple python program to predict the levels of background emission that will appear in in JWST observations, for use in proposal planning. It accesses a precompiled background cache prepared by Wayne Kinzel at STScI, that is already hosted online for JWST users. For an input position on the sky and input wavelength, jwst_backgrounds does the following: - Plot the spectrum of the background for that target on a given calendar day. - Plot the total background for that target versus calendar day. - Compute the number of days per year that the target is observable at low background, for a given wavelength and a selectable threshold.
