The software will load in image collections from Google Earth Engine from different sensors (Landsat 5, 7, and 8, Sentinel 2a, 2b) and the code will identify pixels meeting certain criteria as snow using two snow indices (Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and the Saito S3 Snow Index. Then the area of snow can be calculated for a region or for an individual watershed. Then a chart can be generated which would create a visual that shows the change in area covered by snow across images as a percentage of the whole area. As the sky islands stretch across much of Southeastern Arizona, the software also eliminates the need to download multiple images from differing rows/paths.
