This open-source Java software helps develop electronic standards (E-Standards) for mass properties engineering. An E-Standard is a highly descriptive dataset that includes standardizing functions for data manipulation, interrogation, and formatting. With this tool, any number of users can interface with the proposed E-Standard datasets and still seamlessly utilize their own software methods.
