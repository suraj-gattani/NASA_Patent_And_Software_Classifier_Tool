Develop and simulate Verilog code for AOS Multiplexing and Demultiplexing as described in the CCSDS Blue Book 732.0.B-2. Allow both multiplexing and demultiplexing functions based on GVCID (Global Virtual Channel ID) which is a combination of the Spacecraft ID and Virtual Channel ID. In addition, modify the Transmit and Receive AOS Packet Service FPGA implementation to dynamically accept an input to change the Transfer Frame size. Verify all designs via simulation.
