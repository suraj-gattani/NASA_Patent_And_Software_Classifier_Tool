Kodiak is a software implementation of a branch-and-bound algorithm for rigorous approximations of expressions involving nonlinear real arithmetic. It includes an optimizer for nonlinear real functions, a solver for nonlinear inequalities, and an Application Programming Interface (API) to integrate directly with other software verification tools. Kodiak's Boolean Checker Software Module is an implementation of a general mixed boolean/real expression checker that is integrated into Kodiak's global optimization solver.
