The Flightspeed Integral Image Analysis Toolkit (FIIAT) is a C library for image processing. It provides basic low-level filtering, texture analysis, and subwindow descriptors for applications dealing with image interpretation and object recognition. The library is designed with spaceflight applications in mind; specifically, it addresses the following requirements: - Ease of integration (minimal external dependencies). - Fast real-time operation, using integer arithmetic when possible - Written entirely in C - "Mostly static" memory allocation - 8-bit image data. This implementation is well-suited for the computational constraints of spaceflight.
