The software could be used for compression of one-dimensional data sources that must be transmitted in fixed-length packets under significant complexity constraints, as might sometimes arise onboard spacecraft. The software losslessly compresses data samples from a one-dimensional source into fixed-length data packets. The software's intended application is for seismic and ultrasound data to be transmitted over a network that is subject to packet losses.
