The DRIP-SLIP model automatically analyzes red band spectral information and soil moisture information derived from Landsat 8 and ASTER and SRTM data, at a fine to moderate resolutions, to determine areas that might be new landslides. This is important to help increase the temporal latency for landslide products that emergency managers, planners, and scientists are able to use in their work.
