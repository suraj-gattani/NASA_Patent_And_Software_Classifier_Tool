The code has specifically been developed with the aim of providing a predictive capability to NASA science missions using Hall thrusters. The code has been developed to allow designers to predict the life of a given thruster design based on the actual mission profile. HPHall is an axisymmetric (3-dimensional excavation which is rotationally symmetric about an axis) solver that employs a hybrid fluid/particle-in-cell (hybrid-PIC) numerical approach to simulate the evolution of the plasma inside the discharge chamber and near-field plume of a Hall thruster.
