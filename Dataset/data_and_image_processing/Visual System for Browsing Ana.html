ViSBARD provides a way of visualizing multiple vector and scalar quantities as measured by many spacecraft at once. The data are displayed three-dimensionally; may be displayed either as connected lines or as points; and allow the rapid determination of vector configurations, correlations between many measurements at multiple points, and global relationships.
