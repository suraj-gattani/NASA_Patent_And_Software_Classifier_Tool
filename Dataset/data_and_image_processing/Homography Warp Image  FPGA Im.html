A homography is a 3x3 floating point matrix. The process of mapping a pixel location (x,y) to the corrsponding position (x',y') in a new image involves performing a dot product of the rows of the homography H by the vector (x,y,1), and calculating ratios of the various dot product results. Floating point operations are very resource intensive operations on an FPGA. Our implementation uses a hybrid fixed/floating point representation of H.
