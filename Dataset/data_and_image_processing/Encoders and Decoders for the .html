Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are the best error correcting codes known for a wide variety of communications applications. Research at JPL over the last several years has resulted in the Accumulate, Repeat-by-4, and Jagged Accumulate (AR4JA) family of LDPC codes. Nine members of this family have been selected for standardization by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), and are under consideration for a variety of spacecraft missions and other projects. These codes have three block lengths: 1024, 4096, and 16384 information bits; and three code rates: 1/2, 2/3, and 4/5. Encoders and decoders for these codes hav been written in the Verilog hardware description language, with exactly equivalent versions written in the C and Matlab software programming languages.
