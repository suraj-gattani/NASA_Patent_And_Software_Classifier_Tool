This software is comprosed of two sub-programs (one for MER and one for Phoenix) that accomplish the same goal: creation of a "reachability map" from stereo imagery, that tells operators where operators of a robotic arm can reach or touch the surface, and with which instruments. In order to effectively command robotic arms, operators need to know if the instruments can observe or touch the surface at the point of interest (often determined by the science team).
