A computer program to translate Unified Modeling Language (UML) Free-form Implementation Diagrams into a legacy C implementation of a Behavior Network has been developed in order to simplify the development of C-code for behavior based control systems. UML is a popular standard developed by the Object Management Group (OMG) to model software architectures graphically. The C implementation of a Behavior Network is functioning as a decision tree. Simplfying the process of behavior-based control code generation. The autocoding approach used in this work is derived from that previously applied to NASA missions such as the Mars Science Laboratory.
