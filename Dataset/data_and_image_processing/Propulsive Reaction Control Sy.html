This RCS Model is a C language program. It contains two main functions: (1) The RCS electronics model function which models the RCS FPGA processing and commanding of the RCS valve. (2) The RCS dynamic model function, which models the valve and combustion dynamics. This functions need to be called within the simulation executive. In addition, it provides support functions to initialize the model, set parameters, access model telemetry, access calculated thruster forcers.
