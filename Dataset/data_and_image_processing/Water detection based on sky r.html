Aerial water detection is important for tracking changes in water boundaries that occur when the water elevation changes. From an aerial platform (manned or unmanned), new terrestrial water bodies could be automatically detected at far range and added to a database. Water bodies that no longer exist (such as a dried up pond) could be automatically detected and removed from a database. In addition, drastic changes in a water detection region could be detected, potentially indicating an environmental crisis such as an oil spill.
