The interactive 3D Mars surface view is a Mars terrain browsing software interface that encompasses the entire region of exploration for a Mars surface exploration mission. An example of the 3D view is shown here in Fig. 1. The view is interactive, allowing the user to pan in any direction by clicking and dragging or to zoom in or out by scrolling the mouse or touchpad. This set currently includes tools for selecting a point of interest, and a ruler tool for displaying the distance between and positions of two points of interest.
