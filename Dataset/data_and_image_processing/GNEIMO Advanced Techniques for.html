The GNEIMO methods and algorithms build up on the Spatial Operator Algebra (SOA) multibody dynamics framework. The specific problems addressed in this work are velocity intialization techniques that are consistent with the CICMD equipartition priniciple, techniques for nulling momentum drift, analysis and solutions for the flying ice-cube effect, and performance of integration schemes.
