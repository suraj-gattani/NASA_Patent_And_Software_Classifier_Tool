Processing and plotting large amounts of data can be time consuming and expensive, particularly for data that specify time-varying values, so-called time history data. QuickPlot--along with DthDiff and DthData--helps manage several key operations for time history data, enable comparison of the time history files, and efficiently plot gigabytes to terabytes of data.
   QuickPlot is a general-purpose tool developed to read and plot time-history data files generated during flight testing and simulation projects. Programmed in C, this utility offers a flexible data interface that enables users to read data files in a variety of formats, including those developed using the MATLAB® format. The graphical user interface allows commands to be scripted and read from an input script file. Users can plot data from multiple runs and multiple input files and manipulate data signals with algebraic expressions. (MATLAB is a registered trademark of The MathWorks, Inc.)
   Benefits
The QuickPlot-DthDiff-DthData suite of software tools offers several benefits:
* Powerful: Processes large amounts of data from multiple sources and allows users to convert data files from one format to another
* Efficient: Time-tags data files, enabling time-range processing of a selected parameter or set of parameters
* Fast: Reads and plots data in a fraction of the time required for conventional data-plotting utilities
* Simple: Offers a graphical user interface for command input and data plotting
* Economical: Works without back-end processing systems, databases, or networks
