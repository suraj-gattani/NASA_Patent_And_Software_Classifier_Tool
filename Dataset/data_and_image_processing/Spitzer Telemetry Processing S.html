Multi-mission Image Processing Lab Software (MIPL) are to process spacecraft telemetry and distribute the resulting data products to the science community in a timely fashion. The Spitzer telemetry processing system (SirtfTlmProc) processes telemetry from the Spitzer spacecraft and delivers Level 0 products to the Spitzer Science Center (SSC) and Ball Aerospace. SirtfTlmProc is a unique system with automated error notification and recovery with a real-time continuous service that can go quiescent after periods of inactivity. The software accomplishes the following: 1) processes 2GB of telemetry and deliver Level 0 science products to the end user in 4 hours. 2) provides analysis tools so the operator can manage the system and trouble-shoot problems. 3) automates telemetry processing in order to reduce staffing costs.
