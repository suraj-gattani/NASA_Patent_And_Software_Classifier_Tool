The International Space Station (ISS) uses a fiber-optic High Rate Data Link (HRDL) standard for transferring data. Those designing ISS experiments, however, may prefer an Ethernet interface. This design allows ISS instruments to keep their Ethernet interface by converting the Ethernet data format into a format compatible with the ISS.
