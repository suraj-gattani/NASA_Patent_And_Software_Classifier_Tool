DSN antennas are used to track most of NASA and foreign partners deep space missions. Efficient team collaboration in the DSN utilization planning phase ensures the efficient use of the antennas, thus reducing the cost of DSN operations. Team collaboration during planning is also expected to reduce space flight mission costs by reducing the overhead associated with the DSN resource allocation process and by lowering antenna negotiation time and schedule rework required. GRAPE provides a team collaboration environment where all documents, team knowledge, and applications come to a single access point.
