Not all activities are equally demanding, and when Link Control Operators (LCO) are managing multiple activities at once it is easy to see that inadvertent overloading of the operations staff is a potential risk. As a result, we have developed a new approach to model the complexity of individual activities, and then to avoid overloading individual LCOs with too much work at one time. There are two major parts to this effort: a) during schedule generation (weeks to months ahead of execution): to predict the occurrence of 'spikes' in loading and provide feedback to users so they can make adjustments early in the process before the schedule is firm; in addition, higher periods of link complexity could serve as early warning that additional or overtime staffing may be required to cover a particular time frame or critical event b) during shift planning (hours to days ahead of execution): to determine a good assignment of work to operators that does not exceed threshold values for number of links or overall link complexity, and which, as much as possible, evenly distributes the work across the available operations staff.
