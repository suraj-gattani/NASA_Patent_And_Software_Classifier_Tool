The intention of this script is to conduct marsh vegetation health analyses using remotely sensed imagery sources. The script analyzes vegetation change in a historical time-series using Landsat imagery, as well as current day vegetation productivity using Sentinel 2A imagery. Included in the script are operations such as image acquisition, image processing, and applications of vegetation indices with band combinations highlighting vegetation.
