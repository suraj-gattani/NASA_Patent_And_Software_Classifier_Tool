The Planetary Image Geometry (PIG) library is a multimission library used for projecting images (EDR's, or Experiment Data Records) and managing their geometry. A collection of models describe cameras and their articulation, allowing application programs such as mosaickers, terrain generators, and pointing correction tools to be written in a multimission manner, without any knowledge of parameters specific to the supported missions.
