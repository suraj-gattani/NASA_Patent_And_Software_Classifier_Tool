Each ROI should contain an object of interest or information that is pertinent to the user or system. Thus, the goal of our framework is reducing the amount of ROIs without the unintended loss of an object of interest. We implement the Fast Discrete Curvelet Transform (FDCT) as the first stage in this systems framework in order to have a collection of sufficient Curvelet coefficients. The Curvelet coefficients sparsify the input image and by this sparsification, we are able to locate and extract ROIs. Once the ROIs have been extracted, they are then passed to the second stage of our framework which is the classification stage. In the classification stage it is verified whether or not each ROI has an object of interest. After an image has been processed by this framework, the output should be the successful detection of meaningful objects or targets contained in the image.
