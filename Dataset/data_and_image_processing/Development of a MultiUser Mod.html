The multi-user modem provides multiple data streams for each user. The supportable data rates depend on the processing throughput capabilities of the AD converter as well as the FPGAs. A single wideband AGC is used to prevent saturation at the output of the AD. Multiple digital AGCs are used to regulate the loop bandwidths for each user demodulator. Furthermore, the AGCs can provide inputs for individual adaptive data rate (ADR) control. This is based on a table look-up architecture. It does not require any arithmetic devices (multipliers/adders) only sin/cos lookup tables and counters. The sin/cos tables are generated based on a depth 5 memory with 4 phase states (a 0.5 mod index is programmed but can be reduced by increasing the tables to depth 6 memory) and up to 4, 8 or 16 samples per BPSK symbol. The result is an 8 kbyte ROM with 16 bits of precision. As configured the modulator can generate up to 20 Mbps GMSK.
