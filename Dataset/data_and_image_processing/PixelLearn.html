PixelLearn is a tool for classifying the pixels in scientific image data sets. Based on one or more images on the same grid, the tool uses cutting-edge clustering algorithms to automatically find structures in the image, or to label individual classes and use supervised classification methods to extend the labels to the rest of the image.
