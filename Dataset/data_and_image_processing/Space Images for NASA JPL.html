The Space Images for NASA JPL is an iPhone application system which allows the General Public to view and rate images directly from an individual's iPhone. This system consists of four distinguishing components: image repository, database, server-side logic, and iPhone application. The image repository contains JPL planetary and mission images from various projects. The database stores the image information as well as the user rating. The server-side logic retrieves the image information from the database and categorizes each image for display.
