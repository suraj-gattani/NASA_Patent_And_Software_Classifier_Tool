Perilog software capabilities include keyword-in-context search, flexible phrase search, search by example, phrase generation, and phrase extraction. The technology's keyword-in-context search feature retrieves documents that contain one or more user-specified keywords in context, ranks documents on their relevance to the keywords in context, and displays the documents with the query words highlighted and, optionally, with strongly associated words also highlighted.
