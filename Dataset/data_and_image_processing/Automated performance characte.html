The software expands the effort of characterizing frequency stability performance of the ground system in the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). This method significantly increases the amount of data available for analysis, roughly by two orders of magnitude; making it possible to conduct trend analysis with reasonable confidence. Since the system is monitored daily, any significant variation in performance can be detected timely. This helps the DSN maintain its performance commitment to customers.
