Extreme heat causes and exacerbates a number of health problems, leading to hospitalization and death in some cases. The problem of severe heat is notably felt in Maricopa County, Arizona, where the socially disadvantaged and physically vulnerable are especially susceptible to the effects of extreme heat. Several organizations, including the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Phoenix Heat Relief Network, are working to create more effectively placed cooling centers and heat warning systems to aid those with the highest risk of exposure. This project created a Python tool using Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) land surface temperature parameters to generate heat maps that reference demographics data on extreme heat days.
