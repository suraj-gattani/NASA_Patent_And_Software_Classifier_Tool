The pose data for each image is used as an initial estimate of the geometric relationship between the images, but the pose data is often noisy and not of sufficient quality to build a high-quality DEM. Therefore the source imagery is passed through a feature tracking algorithm and multi-plane-homography algorithm which refines the geometric transforms between images.
