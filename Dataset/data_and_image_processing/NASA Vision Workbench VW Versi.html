Vision Workbench (VW) is a modular, extensible computer vision framework that supports a range of tasks, including automated science and engineering analysis, large satellite image processing, and 2D/3D environment reconstruction. The framework provides a rapid C development environment as well as a flexible, multi-platform system to deploy computer vision applications. The module interface allows new capabilities to be rapidly integrated, and the dataflow architecture allows image-processing pipelines to be quickly developed and reconfigured.
