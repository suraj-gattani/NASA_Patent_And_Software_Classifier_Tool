One of the most widely used methods for collecting information about an object or phenomenon, in space or on the Earth, which is of scientific interest is to capture an image of it. Unfortunately, due to the nature of digital imaging hardware, the captured image is a degraded representation of the actual object or phenomenon of interest. This software coded in MATLAB, a widely used analysis software package, that takes as input any image of an object or phenomenon of scientific interest, along with two reference images generated by the same digital imaging hardware, applies corrections for the three most prominent sources of image degradation, and outputs a corrected image of the object or phenomenon.
