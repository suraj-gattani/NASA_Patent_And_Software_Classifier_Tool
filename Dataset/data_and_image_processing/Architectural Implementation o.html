This software performs the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) Architecture Standard for software-defined radios (SDRs), which is an open architecture for NASA space and ground radios. The STRS standard provides a common, consistent framework to develop, qualify, operate and maintain complex reconfigurable and reprogrammable radio systems. This architecture standard provides a detailed description and set of requirements to implement the architecture.
