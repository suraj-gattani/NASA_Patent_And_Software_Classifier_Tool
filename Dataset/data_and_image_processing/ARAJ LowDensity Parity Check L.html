This software provides a construction method for protograph-based Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes that simultaneously achieve low iterative decoding thresholds and linear minimum distance. The technology can be used for various code rates. Proposed codes may have either fixed input block or fixed output block sizing. Both cases provide rate compatibility. In fact, one encoder and one decoder can support different code rates.
