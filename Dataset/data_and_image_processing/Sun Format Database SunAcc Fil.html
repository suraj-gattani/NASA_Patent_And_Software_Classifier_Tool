The Sun Format Database (SunAcc) was developed to fulfill a need for local native storage of Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) test data. While the file format itself is native to the Sun UNIX platform, the read/write library was developed to be a cross-platform tool and is compatible with a variety of UNIX and Windows platforms.
