Hyperspectral segmentation algorithms partition images into spectrally homogenous regions. However, the exact definition of homogeneity is dependant on the chosen similarity metric. We augment the segmentation algorithm with a task-specific distance metric. Here, we use a Mahalanobis distance metric learned from training data. By leveraging a (small) set of labeled pixels with known mineralogical interpretations, we learn a metric that suppresses uninformative spectral content. We use multiclass linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to maximize the ratio of between-class vs. within-class separation, defined by the Rayleigh quotient computed over labeled training data. Other distance metrics and segmentation strategies are possible, and can be substituted for these choices in modular fashion as different applications demand.
