This is a suite of analysis tools for cosmic microwave background research. It currently consists of an implementation of the pure C_\ell cosmic microwave background power spectrum estimator. It also includes an implementation of the mode-mixing matrix calculation as described in which allows the pure C_\ell measurements to be compared to theoretical calculations.
