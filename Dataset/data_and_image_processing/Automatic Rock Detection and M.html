This software is currently being used by the Phoenix mission for landing site selection. So far 39 HiRISE imagery (> 28 GB) covering one sigma landing ellipse of the three primary landing sites have been processed and their rock distribution maps have been produced. Over 10 million hazard rocks have been detected and mapped. Without this system, it would be impossible to produce such maps to meet the landing site certification review deadline. This technology is also applicable to the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mission as well as to any future surface missions.
