Phase retrieval (PR) and Shack-Hartmann Sensor (SHS) are the two preferred methods of image-based wavefront sensing widely used in various optical testbeds, adaptive optical systems, as well as ground- and space-based telescopes. They are used to recover the phase information of an optical system from defocused point source images (PR) and focused point source or extended scene images (SHS). For example, the Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraphs (TPF-Cs) High-Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) uses a phase retrieval camera (PRC) to estimate and subsequently correct the phase error at the exit pupil of this optical system.
