Structural Analysis Routines (STARS) is an efficient, cost-effective, and unique computer program that analyzes a variety of practical engineering problems. The software is a fully integrated, multidisciplinary, finite-element-based, graphic-oriented analysis tool that combines individual modules to solve complex engineering problems. STARS can be used for a range of applications, including structural analysis, heat transfer, linear aerodynamics, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as well as coupled linear and CFD-based (aeroelastic, aeroacoustic, and aerothermoelastic) acoustics and aeroservoelastic analysis. Because of the tool's highly integrated nature, it has broad application across many engineering disciplines.
