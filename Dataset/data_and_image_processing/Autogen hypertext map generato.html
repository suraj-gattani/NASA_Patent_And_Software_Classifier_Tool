This tool is now being used in the flight operations environment to document the MRO and multi-mission autogen/apgen model files. These hypertext maps are also being used in multi-mission autogen/apgen training sessions. The autogen hyper text map generator parses the autogen script and the autogen model files and produces a hypertext of the files to aid in the navigation of the model.
