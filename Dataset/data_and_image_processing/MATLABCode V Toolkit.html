This toolkit is a set of MATLAB scripts and functions that enable rapid transfer of optical system and performance data from Code V optical software into the MATLAB environment. Typical applications include: extracting prescription data into MATLAB to confirm consistency of various delivered models; perturbing the models and performing various analyses such as ray tracing or generation of point-spread functions in support of integrated modeling activities; and enabling a MATLAB-driven optical model for integrated system-level modeling of wavefront sensing and control.
