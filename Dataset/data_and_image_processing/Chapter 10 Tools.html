The Dryden Aeronautical Test Range (DATR) staff at the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center has developed a software toolkit called Chapter 10 Tools in response to challenges posed by post-flight processing data files originating from various on-board digital recorders that follow the Range Commanders Council Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) 106 Chapter 10 Digital Recording Standard but use differing interpretations of the Standard. This software toolkit will read the data files regardless of the vendor implementation of the source recorder, display data, identify and correct errors, and produce a data file that can be successfully processed post-flight.
