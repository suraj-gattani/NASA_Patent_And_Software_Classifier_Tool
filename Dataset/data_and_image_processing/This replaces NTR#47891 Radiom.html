UAVSAR backscatter data contain both geometric and radiometric distortions due to underlying topography and the radar viewing geometry. Currently, backscatter variation due to topography is the single largest error source when estimating biomass over steep or hilly terrain. Thus, proper calibration normalizes the backscatter images so that only contributions from the parameters of interest remain.
