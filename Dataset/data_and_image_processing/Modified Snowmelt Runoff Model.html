Modified Snowmelt Runoff Model for Forecasting Water Availability in Chile (M-SRM) models daily stream flow of snowmelt runoff as a function of temperature, elevation, snow-covered area, precipitation rate, and experimentally determined coefficients. Using MODIS and TRMM data, the software provides tools for synthesizing daily fractional snow cover and daily precipitation measurements. M-SRM provides daily stream flow estimates for three months beyond the start of the growing season.
