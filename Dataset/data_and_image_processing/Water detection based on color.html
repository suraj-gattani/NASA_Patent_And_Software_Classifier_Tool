The primary goal of this software is to process a robust water and mud classifier for all terrain conditions, for both day and night operations. This may be important for rover operations during exploration on other planetary bodies by future NASA missions. This task also involves assessing the hazard that detected water and mud presents and accurately placing detected water and mud into the vehicle level world model that an XUV uses to plan safe paths.
