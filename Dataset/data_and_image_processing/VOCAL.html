VOCAL Is a visualization software tool designed for the CALIPSO satellite. VOCAL offers an easy to use GUI interface that allows users to open CALIPSO data, and visualize that data on a plot for the user. Users can then use a number of tools to select area's of the plot by drawing 'shapes' around those areas, and label shapes with attributes and notes. Shapes can be exported to a backend database which can serve as a centralized point for researchers to share data and help track and identify aerosols in the atmosphere
