Computer vision techniques have been applied to implement algorithms that detect rocks from images. At NAC nominal resolution it is possible to fully resolve boulder 2.5m or larger and detect boulders as small as 1.2m. With knowledge of the sun angles, the shadows detected from the images are used to generate rock models describing the location, width and height of boulders. A mapping tool kit computes statistical plots and maps of rock density and abundance.
