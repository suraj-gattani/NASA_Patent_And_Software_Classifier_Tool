This software is a prototype of a comprehensive hurricane information system of high-resolution satellite, airborne and in-situ observationsand model outputs pertaining to: i) the thermodynamic and microphysical structure ofthe storms; ii) the air-sea interaction processes; iii) the larger-scale environmentas depicted by the SST, ocean heat content and the aerosol loading of the environment. Our goal was to create a one-stop place that will provide to the researchers an extensive set of observed hurricane parameters (both graphics and data) together with large-scale and convection-resolving model output, all organized in an easy way to determine when coincident observations from multiple instruments are available.
