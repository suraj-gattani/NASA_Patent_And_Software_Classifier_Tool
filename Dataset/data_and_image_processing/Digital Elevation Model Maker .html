This software suite produces data products containing surface shape, reflectivity, and geomorphology for a desired planetary surface. The technology produces seamless sets of digital elevation models (DEMs) at virtually any resolution or size to provide the desired levels of terrain feature detail as a spacecraft approaches a planetary surface. The innovation enables researchers to study a wide variety of problem domains, as the DEMs incorporate observed data as well as mathematical models of planet morphology.
