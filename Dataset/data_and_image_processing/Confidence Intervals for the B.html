When a simulation of coded frames is conducted, instead of just storing a count of the bits in error, B1, we store an additional quantity, a count of the square of the number of bits in error per frame, B2. We demonstrate that a confidence interval for the BER can be computed from B1 and B2. A numerical example demonstrates that previous methods to compute confidence intervals for the BER of a coded system fail miserably if they rely on standard techniques that assume error events are independent. The new method provides a robust, rigorous confidence interval that is a foundation on which communications performance and system risk may be determined.
