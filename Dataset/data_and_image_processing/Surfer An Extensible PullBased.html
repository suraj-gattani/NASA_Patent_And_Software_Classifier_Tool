Surfer examines the pool of potential grid resources and extracts the highest-ranking resources that meet user-specified constraints and preferences. The technology has been implemented as a grid service that is compliant with an Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI), and it can also be embedded directly into Java applications through its application programming interface or into non-java applications through its XML-based command-line interface.
