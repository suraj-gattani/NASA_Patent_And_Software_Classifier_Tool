When performing mission analysis and design of an imaging system in orbit around the earth, answering the fundamental question of imaging performance requires an understanding of the image products that will be produced by the imaging system. At the highest level, this understanding can be gained by a first principles analysis of the geometric image projections involved in image capture from space. Additionally, by basing the tools purely on first principles and utilizing a high degree of generalization, the same set of tools can be applied to imaging systems not in orbit (i.e. helicoptors, high altitude planes, etc).
