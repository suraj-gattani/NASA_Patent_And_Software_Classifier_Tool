The QuIP interpreter, a software environment for QUick image processing, uses an interactive scripting language designed to facilitate use by non-expert users, through features such as context-sensitive automatic response completion and integrated documentation. The package includes a number of script packages that implement high-, medium-, and low-level functions (e.g., analysis of eye images for human gaze tracking, feature tracking, and image filtering). The environment also includes facilities for displaying images on screen, drawing and overlaying graphics, and constructing graphical user interfaces using the scripting language. Currently supported platforms are *NIX (tested on Mac OS X and Linux), and Apple iOS.
