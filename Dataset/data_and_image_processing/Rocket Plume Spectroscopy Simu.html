Enhancements and modifications to a code developed for plume spectral data analysis in 1994 have made the original computer program applicable to the Space Shuttle Maine Engine and the Diagnostic Test-bed Facility Thruster (DTFT). The new code can now handle the non-uniform wavelength intervals at which spectral computations are made.
