The WSTS is currently being used in the mainline flight software development process for the MSL project. The WSTS (Workstation Test Set) is used by the MSL flight software team for development. It provides PCI card level simulation for avionics hardware, allowing testing for all but the lowest layers of the software. It uses POSIX shared memory and synchronization in a Linux environment to provide high-resolution simulation time-slicing. The software uses Linux shared memory to emulate PCI hardware, and uses POSIX synchronization facilities to synchronize the interaction between simulation and the flight software.
