This software should be applicable to any aerial array of cameras. The algorithm assumes that features found in the imagery are at infinity, so it is not well suited to ground applications. This software fits into a larger program developed by the customer. That program collects synchronized images from an array of cameras mounted in parallel on a gimballed frame attached to an aircraft. In addition GPS and IMU data is collected to allow the images to be registered to ground locations. The aircraft circles over an area of interest. Synchronized images are captured from each camera in the array and are stitched togehter into a single very high resolution image is is projected onto an elevation map of the ground.
