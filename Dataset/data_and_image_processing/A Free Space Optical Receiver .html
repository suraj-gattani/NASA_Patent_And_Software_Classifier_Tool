This method is an optical module to the existing optical communication receiver architecture. For optical links with intensity modulated laser transmission or phase modulated CW laser communications the proposed optical receiver provides both data detection and signals required to extract Radio Science data such as amplitude, phase and frequency due to planetary atmospheric changes. We can extract the same information required for radio science data by using differential methods of encoding and at the optical receiver a local laser, a phase shifter, and an array of photon detectors are used.
