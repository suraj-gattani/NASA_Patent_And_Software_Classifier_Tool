Java Pathfinder core system (jpf-core), is a model checker for Java bytecode. The technology takes a binary Java program and executes it in a user configurable way to detect defects such as deadlocks and unhandled exceptions, providing significantly higher confidence in correct program behavior than conventional testing.
