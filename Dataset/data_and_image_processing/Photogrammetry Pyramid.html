The Photogrammetry Pyramid software is a 3D photogrammetry Windows application intended to support the use of a stand-alone reference target system. The software requires images from two or more camera views. For static scenes, a single camera can be used by taking pictures from different viewpoints (two or more). The reference target is composed of seven spheres connected by equal length rods. A sphere is located at each of the four vertices of the pyramid. Three additional spheres are located at the midpoint of the three vertical rods. The distance between any set of vertices-spheres defines the characteristic pyramid length. This length is the only value needed by the user during reference target generation. The pyramid replaces the photogrammetry cube (see: http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20120007627). The original photogrammetry cube software has been modified to incorporate the photogrammetry pyramid. An application and mathematical theory utilized by the software is described in an article by Metzger et al., "Photogrammetry and ballistic analysis of a high-flying projectile in the STS-124 space shuttle launch."
