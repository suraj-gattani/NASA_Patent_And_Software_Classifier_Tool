This program (marsviewer) is designed for quality control, browsing, and operational and science analysis of images and derived image products returned by spacecraft, primarily in-situ missions (e.g. MER, PHX, MSL). It allows all derivd products (Reduced Data Records, or RDR's) associated with each original image (Experiment Data Record, or EDR) to be viewed in various ways, including in stereo, depending on the type of image.The program features a pluggable interface called a "file finder".
