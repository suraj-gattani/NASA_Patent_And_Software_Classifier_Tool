Processing and plotting large amounts of data can be time consuming and expensive, particularly for data that specify time-varying values, so-called time history data. DthDiff--along with QuickPlot and DthData--helps manage several key operations for time history data, enable comparison of the time history files, and efficiently plot gigabytes to terabytes of data.
   A standalone command-line-driven utility program written in C, DthDiff compares time history files. In addition to configuring the nature of comparisons, users can specify a precision tolerance and perform a check for a specified number of significant digits. Alternatively, they can use absolute, relative, and percent tolerances to perform the comparison. Summary output also indicates the number of samples that fail specified tolerance tests.
   Benefits
The QuickPlot-DthDiff-DthData suite of software tools offers several benefits:
* Powerful: Processes large amounts of data from multiple sources and allows users to convert data files from one format to another
* Efficient: Time-tags data files, enabling time-range processing of a selected parameter or set of parameters
* Fast: Reads and plots data in a fraction of the time required for conventional data-plotting utilities
* Simple: Offers a graphical user interface for command input and data plotting
* Economical: Works without back-end processing systems, databases, or networks
   Applications
The QuickPlot-DthDiff-DthData suite of software tools can be used for:
* Flight testing and simulation projects
* Manufacturing processes
* Scientific research
* Earth climate modeling and simulation
* Retail transaction and delivery analysis
