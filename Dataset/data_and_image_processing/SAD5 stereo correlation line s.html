This software performs stereo correlation line stripping for an FPGA. The Line Width Striping can be accomplished any number of times. Each stripe reduces the BRAM needed, allowing even larger images or allowing smaller resource usage.The line width stripe count can be different for different applications, and the image width can be different depending on the camera type.
