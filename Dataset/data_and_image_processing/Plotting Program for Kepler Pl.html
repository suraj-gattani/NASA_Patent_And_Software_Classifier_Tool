The Kepler Plotting Program was developed as an aid to understanding the publicly available data files that have been released by the Kepler project. This tool allows end users to reproduce plots used in project documentation, facilitates the user's scientific understanding and promotes the utilization of the Kepler science data products . NASA acknowledges the SETI Institutes primary role in authoring and producing the Plotting Program for Kepler Planet Detection Efficiency Products under Cooperative Agreement Number NNX13AD01A
