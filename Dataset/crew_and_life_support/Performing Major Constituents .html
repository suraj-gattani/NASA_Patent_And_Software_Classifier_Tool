Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor (VCAM) can provide a means for monitoring the air within the enclosed environments, such as the ISS, Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), a Lunar Habitat, or another vehicle traveling to Mars. Its miniature preconcentrator, gas chromatograph (GC), and mass spectrometer can provide unbiased detection of a large number of organic species. VCAM's software can identify whether the chemicals are on a targeted list of hazardous compounds and their concentration.
