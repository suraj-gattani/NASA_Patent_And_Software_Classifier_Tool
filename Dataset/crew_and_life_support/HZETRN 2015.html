HZETRN2015 is the latest update of the HZETRN deterministic space radiation transport code. HZETRN2015 contains new algorithms and options for calculating three dimensional transport in user-defined combinatorial or ray-trace geometry. More computationally efficient bi-directional transport algorithms, similar to those found in HZETRN2010, may also be used to perform transport through multilayer slabs, or users can opt to create an interpolation database for various thicknesses within one to three user-defined material layers using a straight-ahead transport algorithm, similar to HZETRN2005. Transport calculations may be executed for Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR), Solar Particle Event (SPE), Low Earth Orbit (LEO), and user-defined environment boundary conditions. Neutrons, protons, and light ions are transported for SPE and LEO boundary conditions, while for GCR boundary conditions, heavy ions, pions, muons, electrons, positrons, and photons are also transported.
