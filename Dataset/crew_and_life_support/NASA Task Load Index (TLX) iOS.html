The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) provides multi-dimensional ratings of overall workload based on a weighted average of six subscales: mental demands, physical demands, temporal demands, performance, effort, and frustration. NASA TLX iOS is a full computational version of its predecessor Windows NT, and pencil and paper version. Data collection may be performed through an iPhone, or an iPad.
