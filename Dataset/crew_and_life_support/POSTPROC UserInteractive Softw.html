POSTPROC offers researchers and clinicians user-friendly software for processing and analyzing human physiological data. Measurements include electrocardiography, electromyography, respiration, beat-to-beat blood pressure, skin temperature, blood volume pulse, skin conductance levels, and cardiovascular dynamics derived from impedance. The customized application runs under DADiSP/2002, a commercially available engineering spreadsheet from DSP Development Corporation.
