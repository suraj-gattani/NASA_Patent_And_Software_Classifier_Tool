MATB-II is a computer-based task battery designed to facilitate research in human multiple task performance with consideration for the effects of automation. The tool includes five component tasks: system monitoring, tracking, communications monitoring, and resource management. A scheduling window provides preview of anticipated workload, and component tasks can be automated or manual. Coded in C++, MATB-II has been tested on the Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 operating systems.
