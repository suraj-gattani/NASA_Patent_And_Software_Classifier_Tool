The Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor (VCAM) is a miniature preconcentrator/gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (PCGC/MS) system to be used to identify and quantify trace chemicals. The immediate application is to provide a needed trace-gas monitor for the International Space Station. This software solves the problem of quantifying the concentration of trace chemicals in the International Space Station (ISS) internal air using a miniature gas-chromatograph mass-spectrometer instrument called VCAM.
