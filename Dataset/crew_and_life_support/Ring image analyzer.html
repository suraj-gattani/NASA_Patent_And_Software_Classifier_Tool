This software resonator is used for stabilization of a laser which therefore becomes a reference frequency source for a miniature space clock. Such clocks play crucial role in space navigation and communication, as well as in fundamental astrophysics research. The Ring Analyzer program attempts to recognize elliptical fringes (e.g. Newton Rings) on a photograph and determine their centroid position, the short to long axis ratio, and the angle of rotation of the long axis relative to the horizontal direction on the photograph.
