The DEBRIS software performs particle tracking within an overset grid system from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solution. The particle tracking is based on the particle's mass properties and local aerodynamic characteristics within the flowfield. The software allows the user to specify the location and initial conditions for release of the particle. The code then traces the particle's ballistic trajectory (i.e. any lift force is ignored) through the grid system. The resulting trajectory is output to a file which can be viewed/processed as needed by the user. The DEBRIS software was created to accurately and efficiently analyze the debris transport environment for liberated debris from the Space Shuttle Launch Vehicle (SSLV) during ascent. The motivation for its development is a consequence of the Columbia accident, where foam used to insulate the external tank dislodged during ascent and struck the wing leading edge of the Orbiter. The resulting impact critically breached the thermal protection system for the wing, allowing hot gases to enter the structure of the vehicle, which led to the catastrophic loss of crew and vehicle.
