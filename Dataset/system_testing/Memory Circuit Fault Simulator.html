A initial and final logical pattern are compared and any possible errors are noted. Just as in a standard memory tester where a logical patterns of 1's and 0's are written in and then read out. The performance of the memory is based on the output pattern either matching or being a deterministic result of the input pattern. Each of these separate matrices allows for a wide range of input and situational representation. Any logical patterns of 1's and 0's can be used. Any type of logical to physical transformation can be included in the 2nd and 3 matrix. This physical information can be resulting voltages on sense amps, bit line voltages, refresh current in SDRAM cells, etc. In formal sense each matrix represents a mathematical operator that operates on a corresponding matrix. These mathematical operators can have complex structures that include integer, floating point, or character based conditions and decision points. The application of operators can also include an additional time element to provide for time based degradation of memory cells that might result for long term operation.
