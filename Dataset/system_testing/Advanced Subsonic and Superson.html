ASSPIN is a computer program that predicts the noise generated by propellers operating at subsonic, transonic, or supersonic helical tip speeds in either single-rotation or counter-rotation mode. The format of blade surface pressure data obtained from aerodynamic codes for ASSPIN input is generally not compatible with that required by ASSPIN. The ASP_Tools suite provides the capability to manipulate blade geometry and surface pressure data to produce proper ASSPIN input. In addition, the ability to parse ASSPIN output files and obtain specific output variables is provided.
