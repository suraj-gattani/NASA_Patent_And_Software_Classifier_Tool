This NASA-developed technology provides a rapid preliminary assessment of the design geometry and the design-point performance of centrifugal compressors. The analysis is based on a one-dimensional flow model with correlations for the following losses: inlet guide vane, rotor inlet shock, incidence, clearance, blade loading, skin friction, disk friction, recirculation, vaneless diffuser skin friction, and vaned diffuser. With input performance, the code can operate in design mode; with input geometry, the code can operate in analysis mode.
