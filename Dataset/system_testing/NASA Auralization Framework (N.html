The NASA Auralization Framework (NAF) is an open architecture for auralization components. It is structured as a set of common building blocks in the form of dynamically linked libraries, and will serve as the basis for future auralization capabilities. There are several libraries provided as part of the Framework: a Core Library, a Pathfinder library, a Scene Generator library, a Synthesis library, a Signal Processing library, and a Scheduler library. Each library contains a usable but very simple set of capabilities. An example application and several test cases provided with the Framework demonstrate how to use the libraries together to perform auralization tasks. It is expected that users will build their own customizations on the provided libraries, making use of the underlying framework, to create plugins for NAF that perform more complex operations.
