SWIFT is a multi-block computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis code for turbo-machinery. The software, which solves Navier-Stokes equations using explicit finite-difference techniques, can be used for linear cascades, isolated blade rows, or multistage machines. Three differencing schemes are available: central differences, AUSM , and H-CUSP. Three turbulence models are also available: Baldwin-Lomax, Cebeci-Smith, and Wilcox 2006 K-Omega.
