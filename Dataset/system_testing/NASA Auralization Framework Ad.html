The NASA Auralization Framework (NAF), LAR-18541-1, is an open architecture for auralization components. It is structured as a set of common building blocks in the form of dynamically linked libraries. There are several libraries provided as part of the Framework: a Core Library, a Pathfinder library, a Scene Generator library, a Synthesis library, and a Signal Processing library. Each library contains a usable but very simple set of capabilities. Additional capabilities are available within the NAF Advanced Plugin Libraries (APL). The NAF APL provide additional means for source noise synthesis, propagation effects, and interfaces to NASAs Aircraft Noise Prediction Program 2 (ANOPP2), LAR-18567-1.
