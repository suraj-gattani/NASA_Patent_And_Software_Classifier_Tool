TFaNS predicts tone noise emanating from a fan stage, including the effects of reflection and transmission by the rotor and stator and by the duct inlet and nozzle. Version 1.5 upgrades include: the SOURCE3D subprogram's ability to perform transmission-loss calculation for modes scattering into themselves; the inlet and aft radiation codes' use of infinite envelope elements in the far-field; and the AWAKEN subprogram's use of a new Acoustic Wake/Turbulence File format.
