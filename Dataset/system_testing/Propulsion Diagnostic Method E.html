The Propulsion Diagnostic Method Evaluation Strategy (ProDiMES) provides a standard benchmarking problem and a set of evaluation metrics to enable comparison of candidate aircraft engine gas-path diagnostic methods. The MATLAB-based tool enables users to develop and evaluate diagnostic methods independently.
