AAM is a computer program that calculates community noise from aircraft flight operations. It is a simulation model, computing time histories of noise for arbitrary vehicle flight operations. The model can accommodate multiple noise sources (Rotors, engines, airframe (flaps, landing gear, slats, etc.), each represented by a sphere of spectral data at a reference distance. Propagation to the ground accounts for spherical spreading, atmospheric absorption, ground impedance effects, and weather effects. Spectral levels and a variety of community noise metrics are computed and can be plotted on a flat ground or non-flat terrain.
