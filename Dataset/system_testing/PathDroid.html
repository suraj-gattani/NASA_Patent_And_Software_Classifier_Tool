PathDroid is an extension of the open sourced Java Pathfinder (JPF) verification framework that supports checking binary Android applications for absence of software defects such as unhandled exceptions and deadlocks. PathDroid let users run such applications on development platforms, without the need for hardware-in-the-loop or availability of sources.
