This sectored one-dimensional model utilizes a simplified computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithm to simulate combustion and acoustic processes (including instabilities) in combustors with complex shapes. Utilizing modest computational resources, the code produces realistic results and is well suited for controls development.
