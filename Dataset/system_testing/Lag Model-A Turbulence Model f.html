This NASA-developed technology includes a set of partial differential equations that augment the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation. By providing a mechanism that allows flow history to affect turbulence stresses, Lag Model mimics underlying physical processes to provide an improved turbulence model for flows with separation.
