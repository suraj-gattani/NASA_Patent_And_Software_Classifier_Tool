RSI is a Fortran computer code for calculating the spectrum of broadband noise produced by the interaction of fan-rotor wake turbulence with fan-exit guide vanes (i.e., the stator). Provided with incident-turbulence characteristics, the code computes the spectra of acoustic power upstream and downstream of the stator on a mode-by-mode basis at each frequency of interest. Target frequencies are arbitrary and need not be harmonics of a fan's blade-passing frequency.
