RVCQ3D is a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis code for turbo-machinery (e.g., compressors, turbines, and mixed-flow machines). The technology solves Navier-Stokes equations on a blade-to-blade surface of revolution using explicit finite-difference techniques. Three differencing schemes are available: central differences, AUSM , and H-CUSP. Three turbulence models are also available: Baldwin-Lomax, Cebeci-Smith, and Wilcox 2006 K-Omega.
