The powerful, yet easy-to-use SAVANT quick-engineering code calculates the expected radiation damage to solar cells in Earth orbit. The tool contains ten types of solar cells and four types of cover glass. Radiation damage calculations are based on the Displacement Damage Dose method developed at the Naval Research Laboratories.
