The SmaggIce software toolkit can be used to create structured grids for single- or multi-element 2D iced airfoils in preparation for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. Software tools will measure ice shape characteristics, add artificial ice shapes, prepare an ice surface for gridding, perform domain decomposition, create and modify grids, analyze grid quality, and output grids for subsequent input into flow solvers.
