The RTD code executes a conceptual design for a single-stage radial-inflow turbine. A mean-line analysis is performed for the locations having constant radius over the blade span. Constant span-fraction sectors are used at the rotor exit. The analysis can account for stator end-wall clearance flow and swept rotor blades. The loss model includes stator and rotor passage losses, trailing-edge losses, vaneless space loss, disk-friction loss, and rotor-exit clearance loss.
