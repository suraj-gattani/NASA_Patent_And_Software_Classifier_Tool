JPF-NAS is developed to provide support for model checking distributed applications. It relies on the multiprocess support included in Java Pathfinder (JPF) which provides basic functionality to verify the bytecode of distributed applications. JPF-NAS is implemented as a JPF extension which models interprocess communication mechanisms. It uses a form of partial order reduction to explore all possible executions of a distributed Java application. Moreover, JPF-NAS provides a functionality to check the given distributed application under test against possible network failures which can occur at the operating system or the hardware layer.
