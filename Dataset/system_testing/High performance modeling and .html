Using Chrono::Engine, a simulation package capable of utilizing massively parallel GPU hardware, several validation experiments were performed. Modeling of the NEO regolith interaction has been done after which the anchor tests were performed and analyzed. The ultimate outcome of this task is a study with an analysis of one helical anchor, along with a recommendation on which anchor design is better suited to the task of anchoring on a NEO and why.
