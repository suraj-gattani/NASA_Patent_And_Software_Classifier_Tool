The Fast Scattering Code (FSC) is a computer program designed to predict the scattered acoustic field that results from the interaction between a known incident sound and arbitrary three-dimensional surfaces immersed in a potential background flow. The technology is based on the equations of time-harmonic, linearized acoustics and employs equivalent sources for solving an exterior Helmholtz equation boundary value problem (BVP). The incident sound can be generated by the FSC using a collection of simple point multipoles (monopoles and dipoles), or it can be provided by the user from other prediction codes. Predictions for high-frequency/large scale-combinations yield linear systems with millions of unknowns and memory requirements beyond the capabilities of most advanced computer systems to date. The computational engine of the FSC has been totally redesigned to alleviate the frequency limitations of the code by employing numerical algorithms that drastically reduce computer resource utilization and take advantage of multiprocessor platforms.
