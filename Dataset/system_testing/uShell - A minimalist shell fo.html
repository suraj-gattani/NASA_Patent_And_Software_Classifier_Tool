This sofftware has the potential to simplify testing, verification, and validation of future air-and-space-based instrument electronics designs. In recent years there has been a growing interest in using FPGA-based microprocessor designs for instrument electronics (see e.g. the funding task, SOAR, MSPI, PanFTS, ISAAC). As the FPGA technology at JPL matures from "glue-logic" chips to full-fledged instrument processors, we will need to improve our ability to test, verify, and validate these designs.
