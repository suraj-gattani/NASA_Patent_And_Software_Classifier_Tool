JeNo is a Fortran 90 computer code that calculates the far-field sound spectral density produced by axisymmetric jets at user-specified observer locations and frequency ranges. The user must provide a structured computational grid and also input a mean flow solution from a Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS).ational grid in a polar coordinate system and also input a mean flow solution from a Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS).
