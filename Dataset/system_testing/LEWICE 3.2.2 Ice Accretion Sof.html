LEWICE contains an analytical ice accretion model that evaluates the freezing process thermodynamics that occur when super-cooled droplets impinge on a body. Both atmospheric parameters (i.e., temperature, pressure, and velocity) and meteorological parameters (i.e., liquid water content, droplet diameter, and relative humidity) are used to determine the shape of the ice accretion.
