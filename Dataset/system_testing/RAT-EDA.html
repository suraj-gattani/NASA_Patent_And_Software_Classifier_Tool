This NASA-developed technology is a MATLAB-language computer program for exploratory data analysis. Through the fast post-processing of measured time-series Raman spectral data, RAT-EDA reveals thermo-chemical properties and turbulent-chemistry interactions in combustion. The computer program deduces probability density functions of combustion temperatures using user-selected super-pixel regions for each major species (e.g., O2, N2, CH4, CO2, or H20).
