Many areas of science and engineering require an understanding of the radiation that emits from a heated surface. Specifically, there is a need to calculate the radiation's intensity and spectral distribution for thermal radiation heat transfer, infrared signature analysis, and radiation thermometry. Furthermore, being able to predict the heat transfer rate and the spectral distribution of the emitted energy for the blackbody is particularly helpful.
The need for these capabilities led researchers at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center to develop a set of computer functions that can be used in predicting the behavior of heated surfaces. In addition, the routines enable engineers to use information regarding spectral intensities to determine surface temperatures. They can also calculate the sensitivity of these temperature measurements to unknowns in the input parameters. NASA wrote these routines in Microsoft® Visual Basic® for Applications (VBA) software and incorporated functions specific to Microsoft Excel® software.
