The Scalable Implementation of Finite Elements by NASA (ScIFEN) package is a parallel finite element analysis code written in C++. It is designed to enable scalable solutions to computational mechanics problems by leveraging several open-source high performance computing libraries for numerical linear algebra routines and parallel input/output. ScIFEN supports several different finite element types, nonlinear material models, and boundary conditions and contains both implicit and explicit time integration procedures called ScIFEi and ScIFEx, respectively.
