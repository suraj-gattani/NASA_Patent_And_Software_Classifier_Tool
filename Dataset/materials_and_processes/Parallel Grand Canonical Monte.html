The Parallel Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation code (ParaGrandMC) is a highly parallelized code in FORTRAN for simulating the thermodynamic evolution of metal alloy systems at atomic level, and predicting their thermodynamic state, phase diagram, chemical composition and mechanical properties. The approach taken is based on evolving an initially given atomic system (defined through a list of atomic coordinates of all participating atoms) using Monte Carlo algorithm. The algorithm is based on repeated random sampling of the configuration space of the system using the classical Boltzmann probability distribution. In the process, internal variables of the system, such as system energy, internal pressure, system size (strain), and others, are reported periodically. Atomic configurations, in terms of coordinates of all atoms, are stored periodically for a post-processing analysis, such as phase identification, lattice parameter estimates, free energy integration, etc. The algorithm uses MPI (message passing interface) to work on multi-core CPU platforms allowing simulations of multimilion atom systems. The code is designed to help exploring the phase diagram of multi-component alloy systems, predict solid-state phase transformations such as austenite-martensite transformations, precipitate formation, recrystallization, capillary effects at interfaces, surface absorption, etc., which can aid the design of novel metallic alloys. While the software is mainly tailored for modeling metal alloys, it can also be used for any other types of solid-state systems, and to some degree for liquid or gaseous systems, including multiphase systems forming solid-liquid-gas interfaces.
