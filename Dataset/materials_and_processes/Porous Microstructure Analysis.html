Micro-tomography has become a very useful tool for material science applications, allowing for non-destructive characterization of a material micro-structure at a sub-micron scale. The Porous Microsctucture Analysis (PuMA) software has been developed in order to compute effective material properties and perform material response simulations on digitized microstructures of porous media. PuMA is able to import digital three-dimensional structures obtained from X-ray microtomography or to generate artificial microstructures, and to visualize the 3D microstructure. PuMA includes modules to compute porosity, volume fractions, surface area, tortuosity factor, effective thermal conductivity, effective electrical conductivity, and to perform representative elementary volume analysis. The software also includes a time-dependent, particle-based model for the oxidation of fibrous materials. Material properties and response calculated within the PuMA model can be used to inform macro-scale material response simulations and guide material development.
