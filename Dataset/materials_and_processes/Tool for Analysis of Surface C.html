Created using the commercial math analysis software MATLAB, TASC enables the easy computation of nonlinear J-integral solutions for surface-cracked plates in tension by accessing and interpolating between the 600 nonlinear surface crack solutions documented in NASA/TP-2011-217480. The only required inputs to the program are the surface crack dimensions, plate cross-section dimensions, and material properties. TASC provides a convenient and easy-to-use interface for the solution set that allows a novice user to obtain a fast and reliable fracture toughness solution.
