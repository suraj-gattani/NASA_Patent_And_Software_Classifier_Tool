The STRS SpaceWire FPGA Module is written in the Verilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) language and it encapsulates an unmodified GSFC core (which is written in VHDL). The module has the necessary Inputs/Outputs (I/O) and parameters to integrate seamlessly with the SPARC I/O FPGA Interface module (also developed for the STRS OE). This allows software running on the SPARC processor to access the configuration and status registers within the SpaceWire module. This allows software to control and monitor the SpaceWire functions, but it is also used to give software direct control over what is sent out the SpaceWire link and direct access to what is received from the link. The SpaceWire module also simplifies the interfaces to the GSFC core so that all I/O is synchronized to a single clock. Additional features are described in the "Novelty" section
