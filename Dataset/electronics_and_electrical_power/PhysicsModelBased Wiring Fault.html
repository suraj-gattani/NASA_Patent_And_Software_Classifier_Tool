Providing a toolbox of functionality for MATLAB, this NASA-developed software detects precursor wiring faults (e.g., chafing) in shielded impedance-controlled cabling using measurements from off-the-shelf, time-domain reflectometry or vector-network analyzer hardware. The technology combines high-fidelity analytical physics models for signal propagation with fast Bayesian inference algorithms for intrinsic cable and fault-parameter retrieval.
