The STRS Reference Implementation is a demonstration of the STRS architecture. The STRS Architecture Standard for software defined radios (SDRs) is an open architecture for NASA space and ground radios. The STRS standard provides a common, consistent framework to develop, qualify, operate and maintain complex reconfigurable and reprogrammable radio systems. The STRS Reference Implemenation allows verification of capabilities and provides lessons learned for the improvement of the STRS Architecture Standard 1.02.
