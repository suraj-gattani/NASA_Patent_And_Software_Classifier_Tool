This technology is a Matlab model of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Optical Communications High Photon Efficiency downlink transmit waveform. The model implements the CCSDS 141.1-R-1-v10 Draft Red Book from April 25, 2018. This includes a data source, transfer frame synchronization marker attachment, slicer, randomizer, cyclic redundancy check, termination bit attachment, convolutional encoder, code interleaver, accumulator, pulse position modulation (PPM) symbol mapper, channel interleaver, codeword sync marker attachment, symbol repeater, slot mapper, and guard slot insertion. The model can be used to verify FPGA implementations of the CCSDS standard.
