It has long been the practice to fix double differenced integer phase ambiguities when processing GPS data from multiple receivers. When the double differenced combination of phase biases can be fixed reliably a significant improvement in solution accuracy is obtained. The procedure is complicated and compute intensive, due to the need for multiple receivers to form the double difference. The constraint on the integers is added to the solution as a measurement with infinite precision. This software introduces a new method. First the process, uses a large global set of GPS receivers (40-80 receivers) to solve for the GPS satellite orbits and clocks ( along with many other parameters ).
