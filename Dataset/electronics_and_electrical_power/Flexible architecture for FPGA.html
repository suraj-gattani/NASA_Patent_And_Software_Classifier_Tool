This technology adds a separate small device to FPGA boards in embedded systems, replacing the PROMs, FPGA and additional circuitry previously used for loading SRAM based FPGAs. The device added is currently a small FPGA, but the primary advantage of this technology is that the design of the device does not change, regardless of the application it is being used in. This means that the device needs to be qualified for flight only once, and is suitable for one time programmable devices and even for an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). An Application Programming Interface (API) is included, reducing the development time needed to use it in a system.
