The Solenoid Inductance Calculator can be used to compute the inductance approximation of a cylindrical solenoid of arbitrary dimensions. The technology's calculation method (1) uses magnetic vector potential to provide a more precise estimate of inductance and (2) is not limited to a specific range of coil geometry values.
