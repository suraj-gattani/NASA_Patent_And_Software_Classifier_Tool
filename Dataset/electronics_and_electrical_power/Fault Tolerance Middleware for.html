This middleware we decided to call the Fault Tolerance Middleware, or FTM. In the multi-core system for which it was designed, the FTM resides on a single dedicated core, separate from the cores used by the application. This is done in order to isolate the FTM from application faults and to allow it to swap out any application core for a substitute. The structure of the FTM consists of an interface to a fault tolerant strategy module, a responder module, a fault manager module, an error factory, and an error mapper that determines the severity of the error.
