NASA desires to advance the state of the art in Software Defined Radios in order to reduce dependency on specific hardware implementations geared to a specific application. It is preferable that a single Software Defined Radio can be reconfigured based on a particular need during Flight as communication needs arise. This reduces the size and weight by having a single radio perform the tasks that once required 2-3 different radios depending on the phase of a mission. This software within the new generation BPM for CoNNeCT allows these requirements to be fulfilled by vetting out the features as future SDR's become more than just radios and evolve into providing enhanced capabilities
