The first board to be tested was the Adc Digital Processor board (ADP). The ADP needed a complex xilinx configuration data stream to operate at all, plus timing signals. The IO card is wired directly to the configuration and timing inputs of the board through VME connectors. A slower pattern maker program combines the xilinx configuration and desired timing into a large data file. This data file is clocked out at 40 MHz 32 bits of data into 28 inputs of the ADP to make it run. The formatter board needs data from an ADP plus timing information from the control and timing unit. Data captured from the ADP in its stand alone test is combined with timing information into a large file. The large file streams out the IO card and is wired to formatter inputs. Since the formatter has more inputs than the IO card has bits, several signals were cross strapped (duplicated) making it appear to the formatter that it was receiving 2 ADP boards when it was in fact receiving 2 copies of the same ADP board. In combined ADP/formatter integration, the IO card emulates the timing unit only.
