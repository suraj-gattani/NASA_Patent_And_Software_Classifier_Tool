This software package includes FUN3D (LAR-19247-1) + Generic Gas Path v13: The modules used in the generic gas path enable simulation of hypersonic flows on unstructured grids, including accurate resolution of heating and shear. The routines in PHYSICS_MODULES enable simulation of mixtures of thermally perfect gases in thermo-chemical equilibrium and non-equilibrium. The routines in PHYSICS_DEPS enable coupling of the new gas modules to the existing FUN3D infrastructure. These algorithms also address challenges in simulation of shocks and boundary layers on tetrahedral grids in hypersonic flows. The algorithms used herein have been described in AIAA papers.
