The next generation Aircraft NOise Prediction Program (ANOPP), called ANOPP2, provides the capability and a framework to integrate acoustic approaches for aircraft noise component prediction, propulsion system installation effects, and overall sound propagation to the far-field. The predictions from ANOPP2 include the fidelity and flexibility required to predict outside the current experience base. A focal point of ANOPP2 is a combination of acoustic approaches; that is, to offer several options depending on requested fidelity and execution speed. This allows ANOPP2 to include fast prediction methods for design optimization while including the fidelity required for understanding and provide insight into controlling noise physics.
