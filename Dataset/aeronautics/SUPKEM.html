SUMKEM is fully implicit, parabolic, partial-differential equation solver that can be used for the integration of unsteady 3D turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation-rate equations. The technology enables any laminar computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver to compute a given unsteady turbulent flow of interest.
