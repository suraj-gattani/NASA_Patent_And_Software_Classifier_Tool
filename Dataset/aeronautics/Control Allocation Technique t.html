The Control Allocation Technique to Recover from Pilot Induced Oscillations (CAPIO) system is designed to operate within an aircraft's flight control system to alleviate Pilot Induced Oscillation tendencies in an aircraft without adversely impacting aircraft efficiency. The main idea behind the concept is to minimize the phase lag introduced to the system due to control surface rate saturation. The CAPIO system is designed specifically for multi-input/multi-output applications and this implementation utilizes 1) on-line estimation of phase lag introduced by control surface rate limiting, 2) on-line adjustment of control allocation weighting terms, and 3) an optimization algorithm (available from MathWorks) that calculates the optimal control solution.
