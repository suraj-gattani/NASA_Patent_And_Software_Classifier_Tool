UFAT is a software program for analyzing time-dependent flow fields. The technology automatically processes large-scale computer simulations to reveal salient flow features (e.g., vortices and shock waves) with little or no human interventions. UFAT effectively reduces the analysis time of multi-gigabyte datasets from weeks to hours using state-of-the-art particle tracking and feature detection algorithms.
