This technology modifies the OVERFLOW code for finite rate and equilibrium chemistry by substituting the perfect gas model built into the code with a model assuming a gas made up of a mixture of thermally perfect gases. Four extra field variables were added, corresponding to pressure, temperature, coefficient of thermal conductivity, and the new pressure derivative X.
