MFS (Multi-Fidelity Simulator) is a pluggable framework for creating an air traffic flow simulator at multiple levels of fidelity. The framework is designed to allow low-fidelity simulations of the entire US Airspace to be completed very quickly (on the order of seconds). The framework allows higher-fidelity plugins to be added to allow higher-fidelity simulations to occur in certain regions of the airspace concurrently with the low-fidelity simulation of the full airspace.
