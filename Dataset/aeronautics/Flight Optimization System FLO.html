The Flight Optimization System (FLOPS) is a multidisciplinary system of computer programs for conceptual and preliminary design and evaluation of advanced aircraft concepts. It consists of six primary modules: 1) weights, 2) aerodynamics, 3) propulsion data scaling and interpolation, 4) mission performance, 5) takeoff and landing, and 6) program control.
