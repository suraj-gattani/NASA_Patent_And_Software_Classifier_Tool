Designed to assess advanced automation concepts and procedures being considered for the next-generation air traffic management system, VAST-RT offers real-time simulations across all air traffic control domains. Gate-to-gate simulations can involve piloted flight simulators, multiple NASA centers, TRACONS, and towers. The software's architecture links disparate legacy facilities together with simulation components developed in house.
