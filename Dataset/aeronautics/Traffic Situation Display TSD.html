The Traffic Situation Display (TSD) is an integrated display of air traffic, weather, terrain, and special use airspace. TSD was designed to serve as a primary graphical interface for ground operators/dispatchers supporting research simulation of single pilot and/or reduced crew operations. One key feature is the seamless transitional flow between the ego-referenced and position-referenced frames.
