MVL-15 is a Modified Vortex-Lattice (MVL) aerodynamics analysis code. The term modified refers to the primary modification of the core vortex-lattice methodology: the incorporation and assignment of viscous aerodynamics data associated with the wing section geometry to the inviscid vortex-lattice solution via iterative computational procedures. The strategy essentially converts an inviscid and purely analytic linearized method to a semi-empirical blend which retains the rapid execution speed of the linearized method while empirically characterizing the viscous aerodynamics at all spanwise lattice points. For the analysis of airplane configurations consisting of more than one wing, the resulting spanwise section aerodynamics can be integrated to determine the aerodynamics of each wing, both separately and combined. As implemented, the methodology inherently provides the capability to determine the non-linear viscous effects on lift and drag at relatively high angles of attack, to identify the maximum lift coefficient, and to characterize the onset of stall. Furthermore, the methodology provides the capability to determine the lift and drag associated with the application of aircraft design strategies for lift augmentation such as the use of flaps or blowing. The MVL-15 code is applicable to the analysis of aircraft in cruise configurations; however, it is most advantageously applied to the analysis of aircraft in various high-lift configurations.
