EMTG is a global trajectory optimization tool intended for interplanetary mission design. The technology automatically searches for the optimal sequence of planetary flybys and propulsive maneuvers for maximizing payload delivery at a destination. Designed for minimal user oversight, EMTG requires only start location, destination, allowable launch-date range, allowable flight time, and minimal spacecraft hardware information.
