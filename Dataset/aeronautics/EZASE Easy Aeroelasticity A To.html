This easy-to-use open source MATLAB®- based software was first developed to give X-56A aircraft engineers a modeling tool to understand aeroservoelasticity. EZASE now introduces students and practicing engineers to aeroservoelastic phenomena in flexible structures. Useful for analysis and control design of flutter or gust-load alleviation, EZASE is applicable to ground vibration, cantilever loading, and wind tunnel testing.
This finite element modeling and simulation tool for aeroservoelastic analysis of rectangular wings with trailing-edge control surfaces includes a tutorial on structural finite element modeling (FEM_Tutorial.m). The tutorial uses such elements as 12 degree-of-freedom (DOF) plates and 6 DOF beams. An aero tutorial (DLM_VLM_Tutorial.m) shows how to code doublet lattice and vortex lattice, with symmetry capability. Together, the finite element and aero tutorials can be used to compare to experimental studies, such as ground vibration testing, cantilever beam analysis, and wind tunnel testing.
The primary code, EZASE.m, links structures and aero together in a commented way to produce a wing in flutter which can be controlled. The wing may include control surfaces, or they can be excluded. A state space model with control surface inputs and accelerometer outputs can be produced. This model is used to design a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control system and is tested using margin studies and pole plots. Other visualization methods such as V-g plots (velocity versus g loads) determined using the K-method are also included.
The code is commented for graduate and undergraduate students who want to know the basic concepts of medium-fidelity aeroservoelastic modeling. (Not all methods are coded to industry standards, but it is useful for basic understanding.) All of the details of the code are open sourced here and most is referenced at the top of the file to its source paper or book section. Two AIAA publications--one focusing on verification and validation (V&V) with experimental wind tunnel test and ground vibration test data--are also included.
