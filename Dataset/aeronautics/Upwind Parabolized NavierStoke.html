This software provides a means for simulating supersonic and hypersonic flows efficiently and accurately (under certain restrictions). The parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) equations are solved using an upwind finite-volume algorithm that is implicit in the marching direction. The solver includes models for turbulent flow and equilibrium- and finite-rate air chemistry.
