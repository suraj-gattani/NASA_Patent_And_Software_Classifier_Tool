PLOT3D is a computer graphics program designed to visualize the grid and solutions of structured computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. Version 4.1 uses the OpenGL/GLUT graphics library. Several new features have been added to the code. These include: automatic computation of grid coordinate minimum/maximum; an orphan point plotting function; the ability to read double-precision unformatted data; negative grid index processing; random specification of colors for different walls; and simultaneous specification of walls and subsets for all zones.
