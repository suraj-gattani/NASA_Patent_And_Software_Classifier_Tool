The Quad TCM is a non-proprietary, non-sensitive aircraft Simulink () model derived from Langley Research Center's Transport Class Model (TCM). The Quad TCM is a flight control system (FCS) oriented simulation with multi-channel (FCS) components, including flight control computers (FCCs), sensors, actuators, and interconnect. The models for the components are the original TCM components with modifications to account for the multichannel nature, to allow for replacement with like components, and to enable test and evaluation.
