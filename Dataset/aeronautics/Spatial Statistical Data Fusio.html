A key feature of our spatial statistical model is the spatial mixed effects statistical model that underlies it. Our approach models the spatial covariance function of the underlying field using linear combinations of basis functions of fixed size. Approaches based on kriging require the inversion of very large spatial covariance matrices and this is usually done by making simplifying assumptions about spatial covariance structure that simply do not hold for geophysical variables. Our method does not require these assumptions and also is computationally much faster at those inversions.
