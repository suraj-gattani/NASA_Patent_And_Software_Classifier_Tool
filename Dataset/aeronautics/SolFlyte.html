SolFlyte enables the analysis of Solar-Electric (SE) HALE aircraft and airship concepts and missions by uniquely modeling the complex interactions of time-dependent astronomical, geographical, and atmospheric factors on key metrics such as the energy balance, shadowing, performance, on-site persistence, and design size. Separate functional utilities are linked using the PHX ModelCenter v9.0 integration framework to create the SolFlyte-HTA (airplane), SolFlyte-LTA (airship) analysis models, and the SolFlyte-WND wind data processing model. The flexible inputs and rapid execution of the SolFlyte models broadens the analysis scope and permits parametric design feedback.
