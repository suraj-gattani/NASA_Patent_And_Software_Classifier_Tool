This innovation presents an approach to not only predict the sonic boom ground signatures by numerically solving the Augmented Burgers' equation but also allows the crucial step of efficiently computing the sensitivities of various sonic boom metrics, both at the ground level and mid-field levels, with respect to the aircraft outer mold line parameters.This unique new functionality represents a major milestone in sonic boom mitigation literature and offers a game-changing design methodology for commercial supersonic aircraft design.
