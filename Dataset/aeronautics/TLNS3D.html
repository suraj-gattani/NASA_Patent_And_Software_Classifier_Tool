This software was developed to solve Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes Equations to simulate turbulent, viscous flows over three-dimensional configurations. A general multiblock grid is used to model complex configurations. A multi-stage Runge-Kutta pseudo-time stepping scheme is coupled with residual smoothing and multigrid acceleration techniques to form an efficient algorithm. TLNS3D-MB was the first CFD code to demonstrate grid independent convergence rate for transonic viscous flows over wing/fuselage configurations.
