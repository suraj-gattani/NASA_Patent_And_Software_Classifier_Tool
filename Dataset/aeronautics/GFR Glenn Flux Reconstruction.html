GFR is a high-order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) Fortran code for large-eddy simulations. It is based on the simple and efficient flux reconstruction method and accurate to an arbitrary order through an user-supplied input parameter. It is currently capable of using unstructured grids containing quadrilateral or hexahedra elements.
