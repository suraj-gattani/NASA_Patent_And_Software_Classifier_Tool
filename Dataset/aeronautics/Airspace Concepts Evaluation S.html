From gate departure to gate arrival, ACES is a dynamic, event-based computer simulation of aircraft operations in the National Airspace System (NAS). The technology's software-agent infrastructure provides flexibility in configuring custom simulations and enables explicit modeling of command and control entities operating within the NAS.
