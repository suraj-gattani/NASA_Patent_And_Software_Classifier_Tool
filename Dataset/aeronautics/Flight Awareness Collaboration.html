The Flight Awareness Collaboration Tool (FACT) is designed to assist airline dispatchers and others in managing winter weather events. It gathers all of the necessary weather, air traffic, airport and other information onto one screen. This can be used by airline dispatchers to manage the airline fleet prior to and including the day of the winter weather event. It also has built-in automation tools that can predict the impact of winter weather on airport capacity. FACT is designed to support collaboration between the airline dispatcher, air traffic control tower, airport authority, and de-icing operators.
