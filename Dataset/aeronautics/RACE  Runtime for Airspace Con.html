RACE is a software architecture and framework for configurable, highly concurrent and distributed message based systems. RACE can be used to rapidly build simulations that span several machines (including synchronized displays), interface existing hardware simulators and other live data feeds, and incorporate sophisticated visualization components such as NASAs WorldWind viewer. RACE is implemented as a distributed actor system that runs within Java virtual machines.
