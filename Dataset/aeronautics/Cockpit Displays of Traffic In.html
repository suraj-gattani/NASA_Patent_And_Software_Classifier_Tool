CDTI consists of two main components: (1) the Pulse Predictor for Traffic Display Tool, which allows a user to compare a representation of his own expected trajectory with those of other traffic elements; and (2) the Flight-Deck-Based Flight Plan Modification Tool, which allows flight crew members to display and modify their flight plans graphically, check for predicted conflicts, and load changes into the flight management system.
