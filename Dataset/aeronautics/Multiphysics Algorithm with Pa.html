The Multiphysics Algorithm with Particles (MAP) is a multidimensional adaptive Cartesian implementation of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method with paralellization capabilities using MPI. The DSMC method is widely used for the modeling of gas flows through the computation of the motion and collisions of representative molecules. Computation at the molecular level is necessary for studies in rarefied gas dynamics (RGD) because the transport terms in the Navier-Stokes equations are not valid in this flow regime. The essential characteristic of a "rarefied" flow is that the molecular mean free path is not negligible. The software has been designed to be as automated as possible to achieve a quality solution with minimal user input and control by performing dynamic adaptations of the grid, local time step, and surface temperature. The gas model includes internal degrees of freedom (rotational, vibrational, and electronic), gas phase chemical reactions, and surface reactions. MAP uses an N-Level embedded Cartesian grid system and a separate surface geometry that is embedded within the grid that is made up of unstructured triangular elements.
