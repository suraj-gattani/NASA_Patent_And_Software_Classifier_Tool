STASS simulates air traffic in the terminal area and ground traffic on the terminal surface. The technology uses time-based queues at various locations along an aircraft's trajectory to model traffic. For arrivals, queue locations include the freeze horizon, metering fixes, and runways. For departures, queues are positioned at airport gates, runways, and metering fixes. Flight time uncertainty is modeled using probability distributions around queue arrival times.
