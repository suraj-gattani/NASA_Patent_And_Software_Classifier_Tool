Tool for Turbine Engine Closed-loop Transient Analysis (TTECTrA) The Tool for Turbine Engine Closed-loop Transient Analysis (TTECTrA) is a tool, developed in the Mathworks(R) Matlab/Simulink enviornment, intended to extend systems analysis by providing an estimate of the transient performance/capability of a conceptual engine design. The TTECTrA tool is capable of designing a basic turbofan engine controller, with transient protection, based on the user's engine model and constraints. TTECTrA is built in the Mathworks Matlab/Simulink environment and relies on the Matlab Control Systems Toolbox to provide additional functionality and streamline the control design process.
