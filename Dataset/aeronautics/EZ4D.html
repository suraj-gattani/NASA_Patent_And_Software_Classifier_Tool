NASA's ez4d software is a time-accurate three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver for unstructured meshes. The ez4d software framework utilizes generic template programming in C to allow users to extend the code for simulations of any general conservation laws. Shared-memory multi-thread as well as distributed-memory MPI paradigms are implemented in ez4d to facilitate efficient large-scale parallel numerical simulations.
