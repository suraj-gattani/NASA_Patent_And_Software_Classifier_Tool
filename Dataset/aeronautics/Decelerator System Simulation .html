Decelerator System Simulation (DSS) is a FORTRAN software tool used to predict the motion of a vehicle coupled to a parachute. Separate equations of motion for the parachute and vehicle are employed. DSS was modified from an existing NASA software program for the Space Shuttle solid rocket booster (SRB) recovery system simulation. Martin Marietta Corp. developed the program, called UD233A, for the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. DSS was used to study performance of parachute descent of flight test vehicle versions of the NASA Orion space craft. DSS incorporates 6 degrees of translational and rotational motion for both the vehicle and attached parachute, It models the deployment and inflation of the parachute system. DSS has separate aerodynamic and mass properties for both the vehicle and parachute. DSS is an in-house analysis tool. As such there is little documentation on the modifications made to UD233A to create DSS.
