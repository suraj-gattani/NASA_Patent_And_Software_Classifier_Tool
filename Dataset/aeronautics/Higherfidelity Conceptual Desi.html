HCDstruct V2.0 represents the second major development of the HCDstruct software tool. In V2.0, HCDstruct now includes an aerostructural modeling and optimization capability for generalized tube and wing aircraft configurations. This tool permits the rapid, parameterized creation of aeroservoelastic finite-element models for general tube and wing aircraft configurations and constructs all files required to perform the subsequent aerostructural optimization using the NASTRAN software. The methods employed offer a novel physics-based sizing capability for unconventional aircraft configurations for conceptual design environments.
