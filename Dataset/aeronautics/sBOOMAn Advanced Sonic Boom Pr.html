Very useful in the development of supersonic cruise aircraft, this NASA-developed propagation tool predicts sonic-boom ground signatures by numerically solving the Augmented Burgers equation. Efficient and accurate, sBoom can predict shock thicknesses, thereby improving the frequency spectrum of ground signatures. Because shock rise times are computed and not empirically adjusted or corrected, the tool affords more accurate loudness calculations than comparable linear-theory methods.
