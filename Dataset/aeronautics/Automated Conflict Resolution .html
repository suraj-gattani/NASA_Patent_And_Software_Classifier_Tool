The AAC algorithm generates resolution trajectories through a multi-step iterative process: (1) a resolution generator performs the analytical and logical functions; (2) a 4D trajectory synthesizer integrates aircraft equations of motion using detailed models of aircraft performance, operational procedures, and atmospheric conditions; and (3) a conflict detector compares trial resolution trajectories against the 4D trajectories of all other aircraft in an airspace of interest.
