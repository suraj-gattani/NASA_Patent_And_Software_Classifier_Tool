An aeroelastic and unsteady aerodynamic analysis code has been developed for prediction of flutter, forced response, performance and rotor-stator interaction effects. The analysis provides a high-fidelity modeling of subsonic, transonic and supersonic flow regimes with attached and separated flow fields. The code calculates performance quantities such as efficiency, mass flow, pressure ratio, temperature ratio, distribution of flowfield properties in the entire domain of calculation, aerodynamic damping to assess flutter stabiltiy and unsteady aerodynamic forces arising from rotor-stator interaction for calculation of forced response. This information can be used in high cycle fatigue analysis of blade rows.
