RCOTOOLS provides utilities and application wrappers for the conceptual design of rotorcraft using an optimization framework. It currently has application wrappers for NDARC (NASA Design and Analysis of RotorCraft), CAMRAD II (Comprehensive Analytical Model of Rotorcraft Aerodynamics and Dynamics II), and NPSS (Numerical Propulsion System Simulation). These wrappers are currently designed for use with NASA's OpenMDAO optimization framework.
