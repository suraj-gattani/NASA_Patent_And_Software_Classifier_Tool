GridEx is an interactive software system developed by Geometry Laboratory of the NASA Langley Research Center for the generation of unstructured meshes. The software integrates native CAD geometry access, multiple unstructured meshing algorithms, and interactive 3D computer graphics through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) resulting in a package that is both powerful and easy to use.
