The Pegasus software is used as a pre-processor for overset-grid Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. It provides the hole-cutting and connectivity information between structured overset grids. The main features of the software include automated hole-cutting algorithms, a projection scheme for fixing small discretization errors in overset surface; efficient interpolation search methods; hole-size optimization based on adding additional layers of fringe points; and an automatic restart capability. The code can run in parallel using the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) standard. The parallel performance provides efficient speed-up of the execution time utilizing dozens or even hundreds of processors. The additional capabilities in the new 5.2 version include: support for cell-centered grids; triple-fringe option; automated domain decomposition into multiple hole-cutters; improved parallel execution load-balancing algorithm; and additional minor enhancements.
