PBEM is a rules-based approach to enterprise management that can be used to automate certain management tasks. PBEM simplifies the management of a given endeavor by establishing policies to deal with situations that are likely to occur. Policies are operating rules that can be referred to as a means of maintaining order, security, consistency, or other ways of successfully furthering a goal or mission. PBEM provides a way of managing configuration of network elements, applications and processes via a set of high-level rules or business policies rather than managing individual elements. There is a need for abstraction of the capabilities of the individual elements, thus switching the control to higher level. The benefit of this approach is that it allows unique management rules (or commands) to be specified and applied to a cross-section of the GIG.
