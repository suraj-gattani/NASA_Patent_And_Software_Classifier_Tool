JATS is an action-tracking tool that allows for attachments, multiple assignees, dependent and cloned actions, the export control filtering of attachments, and the delegation of responsibilities to another user. JATS utilizes "grouping" and "roles" so that the system can be tailored to fit an organization's specific needs. Additional modules have been added to allow correspondence management/tracking and Space Station Review Board action tracking. The legal office action-tracking module can isolate legal documents from the general document repository. JATS also has a full ad hoc search and reporting capability. Reporting features allow hierarchical organizational managers to track and report on the actions of subordinates. The system uses NASA-approved authentication methods and is 508 compliant.
