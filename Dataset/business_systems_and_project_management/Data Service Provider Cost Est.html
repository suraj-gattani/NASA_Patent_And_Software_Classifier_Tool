The Data Service Provider Cost Estimation Tool (CET) and Comparables Database (CDB) package provides NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) the ability to make lifecycle cost estimates for the implementation and operation of the data service providers that are required to support its science and applications programs. The Data Service Provider CET and CDB package employs a cost-estimation-by-analogy approach. For more information on the package, please visit: http://opensource.gsfc.nasa.gov/projects/CET/index.php
