This tool is a collection of macros that work with Microsoft Word to export Word comments into a pre-formatted Excel spreadsheet, which is used to disposition comments during a document review and serves as an official record of the disposition of each comment. The tool includes the ability to add comments in real time and trigger an automatic update of the spreadsheet and the ability to instantly navigate from a row in the spreadsheet to the matching comment in the Word document (through the use of hyperlinks). This tool vastly improves the efficiency of electronic document reviews of acquisition documents.
