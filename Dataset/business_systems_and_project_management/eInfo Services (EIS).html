eInfo is a web-service used to provide employee information to web-applications. In some contexts, web-application development requires the retrieval and use of specific employee information.. As each web-application may not be authored by the same development personnel and the support/maintenance of disparate methods for information retrieval is neither efficient nor an industry best practice, it behooves the organization to develop an abstracted employee information service/system to be used across all web-applications where needed. The eInfo Service (EIS) is composed of an API Service. Using this API service, developers can create service calls within a specified application, passing the established parameters to retrieve specific employee information as needed for the specific application.
