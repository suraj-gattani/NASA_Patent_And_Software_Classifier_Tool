The Electronic Timecard System can be utilized by any business or organization wishing to streamline its payroll department procedures. The automated system minimizes the consumption of paper and eliminates the need for weekly pick-up and delivery of time sheets. The tool also simplifies the daily recording of time worked by employees, and it allows employees to "sign" their "time cards" electronically at the end of each week. Supervisors can review an employee's electronic time cards daily and sign them electronically.
