Cicero is a generic, customizable, Web-based database application designed to facilitate the document change process. In addition to providing a Web site from which approved personnel may download current versions of base-lined documentation for their projects, Cicero supports the creation and management of configuration change requests (CCRs). Through Cicero, configured documents may be modified in a controlled fashion.
