The Mission Operations Cost Estimation Tool (MOCET) is a model developed by the Aerospace Corporation in partnership with NASAs Science Office for Mission Assessment (SOMA). MOCET provides a new capability to generate cost estimates for the operational, or Phase E, portion of NASA science missions. The model implements new Cost Estimating Relationships (CERs) that were derived from historical data for various mission operation stages as applicable to the Planetary Science, Earth Science, and Astrophysics/Heliophysics Explorer missions.
