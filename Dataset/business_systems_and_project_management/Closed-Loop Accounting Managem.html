The Closed-Loop Accounting Management System (CLAMS) is a Web-based application used to disseminate critical processing information to the workforce and provide feedback to management that the information was received. The tool allows management at any level to accurately track any critical information, and it also serves as a historical database of what information was sent out, to whom, and when it was received. CLAMS has potential application as shareware to companies using Cold Fusion Server software.
