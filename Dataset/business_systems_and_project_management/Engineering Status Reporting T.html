The purpose of this tool is to provide a common system across the Code 500 Directorate for reporting and tracking engineering issues/concerns. With this tool, information regarding engineering issues/concerns can be provided to AETD Directorate and Division management in a timely manner. This system is divided into four modules: Flight Project MSR issues/concerns originating from a joint Code 400/500 meeting to review Flight Project status; Directorate issues/concerns originating from Center/AETD Chief Engineers, Directorate Managers; Division issues/concerns originating from Division Chief Engineer, Division Managers; and Branch issues/concerns originating from PDL, MSE, Engineers, Branch Managers. Within each module, issues can be tracked, statuses updated, actions opened/closed, or elevated to the next highest module.
