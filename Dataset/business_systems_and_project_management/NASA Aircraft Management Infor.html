The NASA Aircraft Management Information System (NAMIS) is an enterprise resource planning/mission support software suite designed from the ground up to meet both the mission support requirements and the business management requirements of JSC's Aircraft Operations Division (AOD). The system features tools and processes that: 1) eliminate the risk of conducting flight operations in aircraft with overdue inspections, in aircraft with grounding discrepancies, and in aircraft not properly configured for the mission; 2) provide continuous and positive control of all assets including materials, parts, and equipment that exceed a customer-defined value; and 3) reduce material costs and labor hours. NAMIS includes the data, information, and metrics required to support flight operations management and business decisions, as well as the data required by other systems and external components to support consistent and accurate financial reporting and asset accounting.
