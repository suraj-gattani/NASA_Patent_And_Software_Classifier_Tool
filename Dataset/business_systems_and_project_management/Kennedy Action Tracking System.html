In the KATS application, a method of abstraction was used to in a foundational website platform that liberated the developers from the concern of having to manually generate Entity Framework calls to interact with the data layer of the application. This abstraction method/layer provided the ground work from which was developed a "Project Foundation" that has now become the basic starting block for all of our web-based solution development. This foundation drastically reduces project "spin up" time and standardizes data layer and other service interactions to ensure consistently high performing transactional solutions.
