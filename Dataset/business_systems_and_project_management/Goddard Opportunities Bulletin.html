GOBBS is a Web-based application that enables managers and supervisors to advertise special employment opportunities to a broader audience. Employees can be grouped organizationally (e.g., all of Division 1) or by skills/experience bases (e.g., engineering, administrative, etc.). Parties interested in a given employment announcement can apply online with minimal effort. GOBBS does not replace Competitive Placement Plan vacancy announcements that require competition-through-merit promotion procedures.
