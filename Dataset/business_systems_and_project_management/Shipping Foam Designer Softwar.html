The Shipping Foam Designer Software is an easy-to-use design tool that allows the user to select the proper type and dimensions of shock-attenuating packing foam. A simple graphical user interface is provided. The software was developed in response to a large number of documented cases of critical hardware failures that resulted from drops during shipment.
