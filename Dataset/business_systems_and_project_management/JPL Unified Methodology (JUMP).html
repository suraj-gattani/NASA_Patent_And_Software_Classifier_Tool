There are four Phases in the JUMP process:Inception Phase, Elaboration Phase, Construction Phase, Transition Phase Each phase has a list of Major Requirements (and minor requirements), Checklists, Artifacts that are produced, and a Review before proceeding to the next Phase. The Goal of the Inception Phase is to create excitement for implementing the project. The Goal of Elaboration is to flesh out the details, an analysis is done to determine what it will take to achieve the vision and meet the success criteria. The Construction phase is to build it. It emphasizes managing resources and controlling operations to optimize costs, schedule, and quality. The Transition phase is to hand off to Operations, deployment and configuration. The critical idea in JUMP is Iterative Development. Iterative Development is successively adding to and refining a system through multiple iterations, using feedback and adaption. All decisions and artifacts are reviewed and signed off before JUMP Commitment Reviews.
