Used to develop cost estimates/models for space systems, this technology combines an Excel add-in with a simple, robust, and transparent collection of NASA cost-estimating relationships (CERs), statistics, work breakdown structures, and cost-estimating algorithms. The approach's use of native Excel functionality to provide basic calculations limits the overhead required to maintain a model and affords more visibility to the user with regard to the calculations and equations involved in generating an estimate.
