The SPIFe interface allows plans to be generated under complex constraints and reduces the number of team members necessary to achieve mission goals. The technology, consisting of a set of plugins built using the Java Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP), complies with the standards of the Ensemble project. SPIFe software offers several novel controls and visualizations for task planning and a generalized application interface for communicating with planning engines.
