This Web-based, Google Earth-enabled interactive interface provides a tool for configuring, running, viewing, and downloading the results of a CalSim 3.0 Hydrology Preprocessor program. The software allows the user to (1) interact with a map of water budget areas (WBAs) and display data for a selected WBA in tabular form or as a time series plot; (2) edit input and run a CalSim 3.0 Hydrology Preprocessor; and (3) compare results with base-run output and download the output file. CalSimHydro will be delivered to the California Department of Water Resource (DWR) and released as a part of the CalSim 3.0 system.
