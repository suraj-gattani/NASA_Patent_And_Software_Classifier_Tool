NOSS is a web based central configuration interface for NASA Data Acquisition System(NDAS) or can additionally be used as a frontend for other types of data acquisition systems. NOSS is accessed using a web browser and allows for concurrent multi-user access. After configuration is complete, a user can export a xml that can be used in the configuration of a data acquisition system. NOSS is organized around two main building blocks: nodes and measurements. Nodes represent physical and logical components of a test facility. Examples of physical components could be signal conditioner cards, receptacle box connection points, filters, attenuators, digitizer cards, transducers, valves, etc. Logical components could be acquisition system channels, facility redline system channels, or any other software-type endpoint systems. As such, NOSS can be used to track and manage the current state of all data acquisition components on a test facility. Measurements are defined by linking together specific nodes in the system. Measurements represent the full signal path from a signal source (commonly a transducer) to acquisition system endpoint. Additional measurement information can also be defined such as a unique measurement name, description, etc.
