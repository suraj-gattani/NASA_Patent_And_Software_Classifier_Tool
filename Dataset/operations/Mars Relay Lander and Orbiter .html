The software estimates for the geometric relationship between a lander and an orbiter based upon the orbital conditions of the orbiter at the moment the orbiter rises above the horizon from the perspective of the lander. It utilizes 2-body orbital equations to propagate the trajectory through the duration of the view period, and returns profiles that represent the range between the two vehicles, and the elevation and azimuth angles of the orbiter, as measured from the landers position. The algorithms assume a 2-body relationship with an ideal, spherical planetary body, so therefore can see errors less than 2% at polar landing sites on Mars. These algorithms are being implemented to rapidly provide rough estimates for the geometry of a geometric view period where more complete data is unavailable; this is used for planning purposes.
