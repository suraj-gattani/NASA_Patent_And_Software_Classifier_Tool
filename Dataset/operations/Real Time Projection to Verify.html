The Mission Data System software framework provides modeling tools to support the development of goal-oriented control systems through the adaptation of software base classes that represent the relevant state variables of the target system and their associated models of behavior. MDS also includes a goal scheduler, goal executive, and fault response mechanism that provide the necessary runtime support to make these models executable. The demonstration system in which this new capability was developed is an onboard energy management system for the Multi-Mission Exploration Vehicle (also known as the Lunar Electric Rover). This demonstration system consists of a java control system that runs onboard the rover (in this case on a laptop computer) so that it can have direct access to measurements of power use, and so it can be operated by the astronauts driving the rover.
