VECTR (Virtual Environment Computational Training Resource) is a virtual reality platform, built with commercial off-the-shelf hardware, designed to augment the training process for various operations at KSC. VECTR utilizes existing virtual reality hardware and real-time game engine software to create digital training environments where engineers and technicians can practice working with predefined systems and procedures for current and future operations. VECTR is a flexible, scalable platform that allows for model updates, if engineering designs change, and scenario updates, if a procedure changes. All aspects of the VECTR virtual environment can be changed and updated within the software by a developer, even if the hardware hasn't yet been built in the real world.
