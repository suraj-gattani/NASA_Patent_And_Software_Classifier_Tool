The Java Astrodynamics Toolkit (JAT) is a collection of Java components that aid flight dynamics engineers in performing space mission design; trajectory optimization; and spacecraft navigation, attitude-determination, and control systems analysis. Current capabilities include orbit propagation, orbit determination, maneuver planning, spacecraft attitude simulation, and 3D orbit and attitude visualization.
