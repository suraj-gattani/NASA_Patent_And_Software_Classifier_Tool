This technology is a GMSEC-compliant software component that enables users to create and view a display page consisting of parameter and telemetry mnemonic values. Both text and color are used to delineate status.ng bus that in turn is responsible for message routing and delivery. The API and middleware combine to free the components from having to know where other components exist and what data they need. The API combined with the GMSEC message standards allow a component to be GMSEC-compliant and help it achieve plug and-play capability. Using standard messages for functionality helps the GMSEC environment achieve the goal of application interchangeability, where standardized components can be easily exchanged without affecting other GMSEC components.
