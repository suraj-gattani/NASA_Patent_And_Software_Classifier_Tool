These tools are used to help verify software compliance to the NASA-developed Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) architecture. The goal of STRS is to support waveform application portability, upgradability, and reduce the cost and risk of using Software Defined Radios for NASA. ComplianceTool.sh is a Bourne shell script that tests an STRS application for the appropriate method signatures. The output is a web page containing the results. ComplianceToolOE.sh is a Bourne shell script that tests the STRS infrastructure for the required named constants, typedefs, and structs. The output is a web page containing the results. The command and compliance application, WFCCN, is ported, compiled, and linked with an STRS infrastructure to verify static compliance such that all required STRS infrastructure-provided methods are implemented as well as the named constants, typedefs, and structs. WFCCN may also be executed for dynamic compliance testing. The tools are described in "STRS Compliance Testing", NASA/TM 2011-217266.
