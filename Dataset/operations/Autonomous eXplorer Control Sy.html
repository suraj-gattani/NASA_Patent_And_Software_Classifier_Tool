AXCS enables smartphones and other mobile devices to be utilized as a ground-based test bed for operations in extreme environments. For NASA, the technology is currently being used to evaluate hardware for balloon launches. The software's tool kits provide environmental and situational measurements, command and data handing (CD&H) functions, events timing, data logging, and communications with external devices.
