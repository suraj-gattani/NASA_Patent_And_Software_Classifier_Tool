The Integrated Test and Operations System (ITOS) is a satellite telemetry and command system. It has been used on more than 30 NASA projects, from CubeSats to Great Observatories. It is appropriate for use during the entire mission life cycle from development labs to on-orbit operations. ITOS also is a very capable closed-loop, scripted simulator that can simulate an entire observatory or a particular subsystem.
