This software has been designed for simulation of the calibration maneuvers performed by the two spacecraft comprising the GRAIL mission to the Moon, but has potential use for other applications. In simulations of formation flights, one needs to coordinate the spacecraft orbits represented in an appropriate inertial reference frame and the spacecraft attitudes. The latter are usually given as the time series of quaternions rotating the body-fixed reference frame of a particular spacecraft to the inertial reference frame. It is often desirable to simulate the same maneuver for different segments of the orbit. It is also useful to study various maneuvers that could be performed at the same orbit segment. These two lines of study are most time and labor efficient if the attitude and orbit data are generated independently so that the part of the data that has not been changed can be recycled in the course of multiple simulations.
