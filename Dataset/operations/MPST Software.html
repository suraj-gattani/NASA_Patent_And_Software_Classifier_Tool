MoonKommand is used by The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory mission as part of NASA's Discovery Program, which will launch two twin spacecraft in 2011. Each spacecraft will have a 4-camera, MoonKAM instrument. The MoonKommand software coordinates and automates the interface between the SRS instrument command files and the spacecraft commanding files.
