Timeline Builder Assistant is intended to support initial surface operations planning by quickly building mission timelines with the "Building Blocks" method. The result produces a possible approach to completing all mission requirements and is intended for basic feasibility analysis. To build a new timeline, the user is prompted to enter the name of each building block and the number of times it is to be used. The program builds an EVA timeline to complete science and exploration objectives while complying with current human spaceflight limits on the number of hours of EVA allowed per day and week. At completion, the program displays the timeline, number of days to complete all requirements, number of rest days, and number of sites visited. The database keeps a record of activities and building blocks used in all surface missions and is easily searchable by the user or the program.
