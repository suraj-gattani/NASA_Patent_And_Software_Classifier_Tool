Statistical performance testing tool used to test and measure the GMSEC middleware systems by recreatihng test scenarios under various configurations. The benchmarks run simulations at increasing loads, measuring the performance in terms of message transmission delay. The results can be visually inspected in Microsoft Excel graphs, or raw numerical data. The utility features the ability to compare performance of middleware based systems against raw TCP socket to socket communications, providing a better perspective on the relative worths of the GMSEC compliant middleware systems.
