Ensemble is a sophisticated mission operations software suite that has had a dramatic breadth of impact across the agency. It has been used by six NASA missions, four NASA mission analogs, and numerous technology development projects in nearly every NASA mission directorate (SMD, SOMD, ESMD, HEOMD, and STMD) over its lifetime while also enabling the agency to reach out and inspire the public on an unprecedented scale. Ensemble provides powerful and intuitive user interfaces for all aspects of space mission operations including activity planning/scheduling, command generation, telemetry monitoring, and 2D/3D data visualization. These user interfaces are supported by an extensible and scalable service-oriented backend providing cloud-enabled data processing, secure collaboration, resource modeling, and efficient content delivery.
