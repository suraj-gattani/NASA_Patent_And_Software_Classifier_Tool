The Multi-Mission Power Analysis Tool (MMPAT) simulates a spacecraft power subsystem including the power source (solar array and/or radioisotope thermoelectric generator), bus-voltage control, secondary battery (lithium-ion or nickel-hydrogen), thermostatic heaters and power-consuming equipment. It handles multiple mission types including heliocentric orbiters, planetary orbiters and surface operations.
