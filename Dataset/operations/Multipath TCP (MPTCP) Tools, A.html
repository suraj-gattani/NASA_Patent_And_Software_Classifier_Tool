A collection of tools, scripts, and configurations to allow the use of Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) across multiple point to point interfaces such as those commonly used for satellite and optical links. This collection includes configurations for Multipath TCP (a new transport protocol) and other networking scripts which were used to benefit NASA's Earth Science Project which uses multiple Iridium satellite links. Also included is a set of tools to analyze MPTCP traffic to better understand the data flow, metrics, and performance of the system. The tool can be used for any MPTCP connections and is not specific to multiple point to point interfaces.
