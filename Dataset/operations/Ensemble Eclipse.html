The open source integrated development environment (IDE) Eclipse is a powerful and useful tool that is at the heart of the Ensemble Project, a cross-center collaboration between JPL, Ames, and JSC, with 20 to 40 active participants at any given time. Setting up an Eclipse environment to be compatible with Ensemble code development is both time consuming and error prone. A skill developer generally takes between 1 and 2 hours to get a new environment fully set up. We have developed a process for building and distributing each new version of "Ensemble Eclipse" to the members of the Ensemble project. Ensemble Eclipse is a prebuilt Eclipse environment which contains all of the necessary plugins, preferences and other settings in order to be able to build and run Ensemble-based software. This software has generally saved NASA several hundred work-hours every year.
