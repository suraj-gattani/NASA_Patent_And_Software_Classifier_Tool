The three programs contained in this software (marsuvw, marsrough, and marsslope) are part of the OPGS (Operational Product Generation Subsystem) automated pipeline, which analyzes images returned by in-situ spacecraft and creates higher-level products to assist in operations, science, and outreach. These specific programs take the XYZ data derived from stereo analysis and create higher-level products such as surface normals, roughness maps, and various kinds of slope maps. These products are used by rover planners and other operations team personnel to help drive the vehicle or operate the arm. The secondary programs are used for special processing requests in operations.
