Any hyperspectral imager of the Martian surface will encounter atmospheric absorption that must be corrected. The ATMO measure will then be useful as a measure of how well/completely the distortion was removed. This is true for orbiters (such as CRISM/MRO) and in-situ labs such as MSL. The Advanced Multimission Operations System enables Principal Investigators to directly, immediately, flexibly and seamlessly interact with their instruments and their data from wherever they are located.
