The APLNav system provides a simple, cost-effective, reliable, and proven optical terrain navigation tool for planetary landing applications. Passive optical digital cameras are used to create surface images that are rendered against a digital elevation model. The system is derived from the digital scene-mapping and area correlation navigation method that has been employed by cruise missiles for decades.
