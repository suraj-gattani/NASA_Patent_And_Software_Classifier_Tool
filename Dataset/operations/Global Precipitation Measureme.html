The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) spacecraft (S/C) flight software (FSW) controls and coordinates all aspects of the spacecraft's operation in nominal and anomolous conditions. It distributes commands to, and collects data from, all spacecraft subsystems and the science instruments. The FSW controls high gain antenna pointing to TDRSS satellites and manages communications with the ground controllers in real time to receive commands (during SSA contacts) and send housekeeping telemetry data during SSA and MA contacts. It sends science data using the Class-2 CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP). The GPM FSW monitors the health of most orbiter subsystems and takes corrective actions when necessary. The GPM FSW controls the pointing of the spacecraft/instruments to the earth's surface, the orientation of the solar arrays to collect power, and the pointing of the high gain antenna to communicate with TDRSS. The GPM FSW uses the propulsion system to perform orbit station keeping and re-entry upon mission completion. The GPM FSW also implements a safehold controller and can perform "yaw maneuvers" to re-orient the spacecraft velocity vector by 180 degrees. The GPM FSW uses Goddard's Operating System Abstration Layer (OSAL) and the Core Flight Executive (cFE) software. Ten Core Flight System (CFS) applications were co-developed by GPM and Code 582 and are now available in the Code 582 library for future mission use.
