The software is part of the OPGS (Operational Product Generation Subsystem) software suite. It performs correction of brightness/contrast differences at seams between images in mosaics. In-situ missions, such as Mars Exploration Rover (MER), Phoenix (PHX), and Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)-NASA Planetary Exploration Mission, typically have pointable mast-mounted cameras, which are capable of taking panoramic mosaics comprised of many individual frames.
