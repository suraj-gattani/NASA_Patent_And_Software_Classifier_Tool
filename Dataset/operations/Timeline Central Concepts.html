This report further defines the key concepts of immutability, versioning, timeline type, timeline name, timeline instance, and timeline value. This report also defines the SCN, which is the formal underpinning of versioning, immutability, and undo. Other reports build upon these concepts to define particular timeline types, a timeline-based spacecraft operations architecture, and a software implementation.
