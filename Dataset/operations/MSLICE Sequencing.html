This tool was developed for the NASA Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. MSLICE Sequencing is a graphical tool for writing sequences and integrating them into RML files, as well as producing SCMF files for uplink. When operated in a testbed environment, it also supports uplinking these SCMF files to the testbed via Chill.
