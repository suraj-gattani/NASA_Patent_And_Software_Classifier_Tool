The Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP) is a general software tool that can perform complex fluid flow analysis in a wide variety of applications, including those related to chemical processing, gas processing, power plants, hydraulic control circuits, and various kinds of fluid distribution systems. Example problems can be used effectively as a teaching aid to students as part of their senior undergraduate or graduate coursework.
