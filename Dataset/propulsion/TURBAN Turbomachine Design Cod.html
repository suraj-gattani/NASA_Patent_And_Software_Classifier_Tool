TURBAN analysis is performed at the arithmetic mean diameter. The stage velocity diagrams are either all similar (therefore have the same work factor) or are determined from an input stage work split. All stages have the same stator exit angle. Stage-by-stage tailoring of the velocity diagrams is not allowed.
