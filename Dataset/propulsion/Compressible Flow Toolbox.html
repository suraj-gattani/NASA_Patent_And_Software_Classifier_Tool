The Compressible Flow Toolbox is a set of algorithms that solve classical compressible equations for isentropic flow, fanno flow, Rayleigh flow, normal shock, oblique shock, and expansion. Implemented in the MATLAB programming language, the technology can be used in the analysis of one-dimensional steady flow with constant entropy, with friction, with heat transfer, or with supersonic Mach numbers.
