MAPSS is a flexible turbofan engine simulation environment that provides easy access to health, control, and engine parameters through a graphical user interface. The technology can be used as a simulation environment for developing and testing advanced control algorithms, or it can run transient simulations or generate state-space linear models for creating a piecewise linear controller.
