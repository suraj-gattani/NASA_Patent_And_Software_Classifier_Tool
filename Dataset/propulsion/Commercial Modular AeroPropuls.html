Developed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, C-MAPSS40k is a high-fidelity transient simulation of a generic commercial turbofan engine with a 40,000-pound thrust. The nonlinear physics-based component-level model operates up to Mach 0.8 over a wide ambient temperature range and executes faster than real time. The model can be run from the command line or by using a graphical user interface.
