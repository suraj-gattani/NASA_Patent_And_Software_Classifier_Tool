T-MATS is open source software code. The Toolbox for the Modeling and Analysis of Thermodynamic Systems (T-MATS) is a Simulink toolbox intended for use in the modeling and simulation of thermodynamic systems and their controls. T-MATS contains generic thermodynamic and controls components that may be combined with a variable input iterative solver and optimization algorithm to create complex systems to meet the needs of a developer. Developement of this tool was completed on behalf of the NASA Aviation Safety Program's Vehicle Systems Safety Technologies (VSST) project located at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, OH.
