APNASA simulates the three-dimensional viscous flowfield through an entire compressor or turbine consisting of multiple rows of blades in a single computational job. A grid is generated which encompasses all blade rows. Boundary conditions are imposed upstream of the first blade row and downstream of the last blade row-no boundary conditions are set between blade rows. The code marches forward in time on the flowfield solution within all the blade rows. During the solution process the code periodically calculates the time-average glow in each of the blade rows and information required to model blade-row interaction effects between each blade row and its neighbors. The code passes this information to all of the blade rows as it continues forward in time. When the solution converges to a user-specified tolerance, the simulation of the flowfield through the entire turbomachine is realized and the user obtains a time-average description of the three-dimensional viscous flow in each blade row. Since information on blade row interactions is passed from row-to-row throughout the solution process, the simulation includes the time-average effects of neighboring blade rows on one another
