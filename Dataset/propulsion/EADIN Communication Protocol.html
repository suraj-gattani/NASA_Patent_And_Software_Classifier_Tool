The product of this work is a communication protocol which allows microcontrollers to talk with eachother in a structured fashion. As such, it is embodied in C code that runs on the microcontroller. The software is not mission certified and is being used for demonstration and testing purposes only. The current goal of this project is to realease the software open source to enable community participation. We have external companies requesting that we release this software.
