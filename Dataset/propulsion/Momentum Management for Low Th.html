MomProf was developed to operate in the MATLAB environment providing an easy user interface. All data is loaded into MATLAB as a structure to provide easy, consistent access to all inputs by individual functions within the tool. A configuration file provides infrequently changed parameters such as RWA inertia, S/C inertia, and the rotation matrix defining the alignment of the each RWA in the Body frame. The tab delimited input file contains time, attitude, s/c rate, and mode information. Used in its most basic application, the Dawn momentum tool uses the basic principle of angular momentum computing momentum in the body frame, and RWA wheel speeds, for all given orientations in the input file.
