CCODP is a one-dimensional off-design performance prediction code used for centrifugal compressors. Correlations account for the following types of loss: inlet guide vane, impeller incidence, shock, skin friction, blade loading, trailing edge, clearance, vaneless and vaned diffuser friction, recirculation, and disk friction.
