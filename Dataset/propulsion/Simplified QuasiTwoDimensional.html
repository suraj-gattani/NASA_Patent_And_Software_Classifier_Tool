A quasi-two-dimensional, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation of a rotating detonation engine (RDE) has been developed. The simulation operates in the detonation frame of reference and utilizes a relatively coarse grid such that only the essential primary flow field structure is captured. This construction and other simplifications yield rapidly converging, steady solutions that can be obtained on a modern single processor computer. Viscous effects, and heat transfer effects are modeled using source terms. The effects of potential inlet flow reversals are modeled using boundary conditions. Output from the simulation compares favorably to measured data from numerous experimental RDE rigs. The speed and fidelity of the code render it useful as a performance optimization tool as well as a diagnostic tool to supplement the current limitations of experimental measurement techniques in the hostile engine environment.
