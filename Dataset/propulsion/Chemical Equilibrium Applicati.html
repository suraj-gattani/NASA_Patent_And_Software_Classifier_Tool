The CEA program calculates chemical equilibrium product concentrations from any set of reactants and determines thermodynamic and transport properties for the product mixture. Built-in applications account for theoretical rocket performance, Chapman-Jouguet detonation parameters, shock-tube parameters, and combustion properties.
