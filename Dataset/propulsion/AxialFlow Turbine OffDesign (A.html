AXOD computes the flow and efficiency of multistage axial-flow turbines as functions of speed and pressure ratio. The technology uses a span-line analysis with simple radial equilibrium. The loss model includes blade-row inlet losses, blade-row losses, and stage-test losses. Coefficients are selected to match the known design-point performance, and the internal model provides the off-design performance.
