ACD is an analysis code used for the aerodynamic design of multistage axial-flow compressors. The technology provides velocity diagrams on the streamlines at the blade-row edges. Blade elements are defined by centerline curve and thickness distribution, and blade-element inlet and outlet angles are established through empirical incidence and deviation-angle adjustments to the velocity diagrams. Blade elements can be stacked to provide the full blade design.
