Developed for studying variable geometry effects at the conceptual design level, CMPSTK is a combination of the STGSTK and CMPGEN computer codes. STGSTK predicts multistage axial-flow compressor off-design performance using mean-line stage stacking, and CMPGEN estimates design-speed flow range and efficiency ratios.
