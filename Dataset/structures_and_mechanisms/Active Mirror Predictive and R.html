This software will be used for the future development of NASA space telescope mirrors including TPF, ATLAST, and the International Space Station Observatory. The Active Mirror Predictive and Requirements Verification Software (AMP-ReVS) blends together Finite Element Model (FEM) predictions and laboratory measured data for large (1-m class) optical quality mirrors with figure control actuators (i.e. active mirrors). It computes phenomenological contributions to the surface figure error using various built-in optimization techniques.
