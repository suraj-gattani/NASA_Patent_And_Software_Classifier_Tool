Supporting the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate guidelines, the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) has developed an O3 tool to leverage existing tools and practices, and allows the easy integration and adoption of new state-of-the-art software. This object-oriented framework will integrate the analysis codes for multiple disciplines, instead of relying on one code to perform the analysis for all disciplines. Optimization can then take place within each discipline module, or in a loop between the central executive module and the discipline modules, or both. This version uses a public-domain optimization code, Automated Design Synthesis (ADS) version 1.10, instead of using the DOT code. We tested this updated version using couple of sample test problems. The public domain code, ADS version 1.10, was developed by Vanderplaats using NASAs budget around 1984.
