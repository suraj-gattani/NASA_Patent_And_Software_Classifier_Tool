This MATLAB routine generates a scalable finite element model suitable for hybrid wing-body (HWB) structural analysis and optimization. HWB geometry structure is based on a vehicle sketch-pad (VSP) surface model of an aircraft and a FLOPS-compatible parameterization of the center body and wing structure. Optimization and weight calculation are based on a Nastran finite element analysis of the primary structural components.
