This technology is simply a stripped down version of a previously released code to create an open source Mini-App for LaRC's High Performance Computing Incubator (HPCI). The purpose of a Mini-App is to isolate the most intensive part of a code for release so it can be optimized through collaboration. ScIFEN is a code for solving large scale computational materials and structures problems using the finite element method. This Mini-App isolates the linear solver that ScIFEN uses and loads an example system from file as a test case. It represents roughly 1% of the total source code.
