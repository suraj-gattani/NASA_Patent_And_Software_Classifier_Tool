The VLOADS program calculates launch vehicles' in-flight structural loads for preliminary design. The program may also be used to calculate structural loads for upper stages and planetary transfer vehicles. Launch vehicle information and input data such as aerodynamic coefficients, mass properties, propellants, engine thrusts, and performance data are compiled and analyzed by VLOADS to produce distributed shear loads, bending moments, axial forces, and vehicle line loads as a function of X-station along the vehicle's length. Translational accelerations and interface loads, if the launch vehicle has booseters or wings, are also computed.
