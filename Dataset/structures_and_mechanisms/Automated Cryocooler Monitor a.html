This software is used in an automated cryogenic control system developed to monitor and control the operation of small-scale crycoolers. The system was designed to automate cryogenically cooled low-noise-amplifier systems used in the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). It automates the entire operation of the system including cool down, warm-up and performance monitoring.
