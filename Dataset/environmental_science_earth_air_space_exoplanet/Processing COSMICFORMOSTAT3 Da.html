Using the principle of maximum entropy and the analytic structure of the code- and phase-based ionospheric combinations a new weighting scheme for providing a weighted average of the difference of the code- and phase-based combinations is developed. These new weights are derived from the minimal information content of the multipath, under the assumption that the distribution itself is unknown. Hardware biases are computed under the assumption that the high latitude ionosphere is small (<1.0 TECU). Studies of the plasmasphere and ionosphere show this to be true and as such, the hardware bias can be assumed to be all of the remaining time delay for the upward looking high latitude observations.
