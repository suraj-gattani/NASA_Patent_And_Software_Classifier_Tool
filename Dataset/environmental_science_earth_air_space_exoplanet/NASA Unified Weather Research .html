At NASA, WRF is being used to study: the precipitation processes associated with several high-impact weather events; aerosol impact on the area climate and water cycles over monsoon regions; the influence of land surface heterogeneity and soil moisture gradients on land-atmosphere interactions; explicit simulations of hurricanes; and interactive chemistry-aerosol processes.
