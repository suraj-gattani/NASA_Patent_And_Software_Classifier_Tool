The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) is a NASA Earth Science Mission that launched in December 2016. Currently, however, synthetic wind data in the format that will be used post-launch can be produced from current observations or model output via the CYGNSS End-to-End Simulator (E2ES). The present software, which is written in the Python language, was developed to facilitate the ingest, analysis, and display of CYGNSS data.
