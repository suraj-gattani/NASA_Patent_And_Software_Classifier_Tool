A particle trajectory model, Particle Trajectory with Qshep interpolation (PTQ), was previously developed to describe the path of rocket plume ejected particles on the lunar surface, predicting the distance particles travel and their impact velocities. A modification of PTQ was made to support the study of the disdrometer derived Z-R relation. The new version, Particle Trajectory with Shepards interpolation for Raindrops (PTS-R), incorporates an empirical relation between particle diameter D and the drag shape factor Sf to account for the fact that raindrops, unlike lunar soil particles, change shape in response to aerodynamic forces. A relationship was empirically determined relating Sf to particle diameter D for raindrops. The software also supports the original plume driven dust/soil particle application.
