This code is integral to generating products for the currently active UAVSAR sensor/program. Repeat pass radar interferometry is integral to current geophysical research as it provides the only technique possible of obtaining highly accurate (millimeter level) and spatially dense surface deformation measurements. This technique is integral to the planned DESDynI mission that will employ L-band repeat pass radar interferometry to make surface deformation measurements over all the tectonically active regions of the earth surface.
