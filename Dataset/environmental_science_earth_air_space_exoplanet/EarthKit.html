EarthKit provides a framework for collaboration among researchers in Earth science. It provides a set of software tools for sharing any user's research environment via the web and managing workflows that run in the cloud. By leveraging cloud computing services in this novel way, EarthKit can instantly replicate a reesarch computing environment (software, data, operating system environment and hardware).
