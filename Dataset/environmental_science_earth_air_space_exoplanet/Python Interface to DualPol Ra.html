This is an object-oriented Python module that facilitates precipitation retrievals (e.g., hydrometeor type, precipitation rate, precipitation mass, particle size distribution information) from polarimetric radar data. It leverages existing open source radar software packages to perform all-in-one retrievals that are then easily visualized or saved using existing software.
