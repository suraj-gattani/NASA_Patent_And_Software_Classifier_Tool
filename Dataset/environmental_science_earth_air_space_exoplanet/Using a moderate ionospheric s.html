The current WAAS ionospheric threat model provides terms used to inflate the GIVEs that are independent of the state of the ionosphere. In our technology, the ionospheric threat model is separated into two branches - one to be used when the ionosphere is quiet and one to be used when it is disturbed. Threats that cause the moderate storm detector to trip are eliminated from the quiet-time branch of the threat model. Using this quiet-time branch under nominal ionospheric conditions significantly reduces the magnitude of the users computed protection limits, thereby dramatically improving WAAS availability.
