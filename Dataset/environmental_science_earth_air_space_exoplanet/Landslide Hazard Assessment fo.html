This framework integrates a regional landslide susceptibility map and satellite-based rainfall estimates into a binary decision tree model, considering both daily and antecedent rainfall. Using a regionally distributed, percentile-based threshold approach, the model outputs a pixel-by-pixel nowcast in near real-time at a resolution of 30 arcseconds to identify areas of moderate and high landslide hazard.
