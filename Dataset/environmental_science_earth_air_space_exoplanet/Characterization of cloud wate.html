The fundamental problem of cloud parameterization is to characterize the distributions of cloud variables at sub-grid scales and to relate the sub-grid variations to the resolved flow. This software solves the problem by estimating the probability density function of cloud water content at the sub-grid scale using CloudSat measurements. This tool uses a statistical method called Maximum Likelihood Estimation to estimate the probability density function of the cloud water content.
