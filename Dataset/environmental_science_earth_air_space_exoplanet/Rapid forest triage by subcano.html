Based on an existing micro air vehicle system that executes an autonomous navigation frame work to maneuver in GPS-denied environments, close to the ground and in highly cluttered environments, a data processing framework was developed to analyze imagery from an on-board forward looking stereo vision system to calculate tree trunk distribution maps. This includes estimating the forest floor profile, detecting tree trunks in the images and calculating diameter of tree trunks at a certain height above the ground. The new technology includes all individual components at a low TRL level. Processing is currently done off-line from collected images which are manually labeled to compare tree diameter and position estimations with ground truth. The frame work was tested on data from an example forest of live oak.
