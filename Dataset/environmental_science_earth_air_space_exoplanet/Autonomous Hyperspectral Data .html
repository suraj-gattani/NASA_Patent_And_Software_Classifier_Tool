Software rapidly processes hyperspectral data, correcting for incident sunlight where necessary and atmospheric transmission,detects thermally-anomalous pixels, fits data with model black-body thermal emission spectra to determine radiant flux, calculates atmospheric convection thermal removal, and then calculates total heat loss. From these results, an effusion rate estimation is made. Maps are generated of thermal emission and location. Products are posted online, and relevant parties notified. Effusion rate data added to historical record and plotted to identify spikes in activity for persistently erupting eruptions. The entire process from start to end is autonomous.
