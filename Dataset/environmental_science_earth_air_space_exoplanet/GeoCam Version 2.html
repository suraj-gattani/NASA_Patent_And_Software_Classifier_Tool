GeoCam is a geospatial system for disaster response that consists of (1) low-cost consumer hardware (i.e., a digital camera or cell phone, position/orientation sensors, and an optional embedded controller) and (2) a Web-based workflow that enables images and other geo-referenced data to be shared and viewed in a variety of ways. GeoCam includes software that computes image location and provides for geo-rectification, KML-formatted geospatial data generation, image management, and geo-referenced data sharing.
