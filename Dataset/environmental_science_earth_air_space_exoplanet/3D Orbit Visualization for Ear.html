A software application was developed to visualize orbit paths for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO). This software enables interactive exploration of spacecraft orbit paths and ground footprint paths in a 3D environment. Detailed information about any particular observation frame is available through a point-and-click "drill down" capability.
