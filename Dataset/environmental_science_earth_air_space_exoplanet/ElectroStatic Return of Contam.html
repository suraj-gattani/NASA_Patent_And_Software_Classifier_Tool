The ElectroStatic Return of Contaminants (ESR) tool is a first-generation computational code created for the purpose of computing the return characteristics of spacecraft-generated contaminants. The code computes the Debye sheath (if necessary), the returned contaminant mass rate, returned mass flux, returned mass ratio, return velocity, and surface sputter (where applicable). To help the user, default values have been supplied for all program inputs.
