The focus of Trapped Radiation Models software development effort was to help spacecraft and payload designers to account for uncertainties in predictive models of the Earth's trapped radiation environment. A tool was needed for more accurately determining radiation requirements and risks -- essential elements for producing less expensive, more reliable spacecraft.
