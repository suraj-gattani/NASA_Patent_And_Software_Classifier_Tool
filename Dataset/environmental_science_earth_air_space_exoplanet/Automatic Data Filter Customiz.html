This software attempts to predict whether our retrieval algorithm to recover CO2 concentration from the input spectra of GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) will converge or diverge. This was accomplished to eliminate needless runtime on runs that would never converge. Thus, a space of 50 dimensions must be examined to predict whether convergence will be achieved Retrieval algorithms are frequently expensive to run, and wasted effort defeats requirements and expends needless resources. This algorithm could be used to help predict and filter unneeded runs in any computationally expensive regime.
