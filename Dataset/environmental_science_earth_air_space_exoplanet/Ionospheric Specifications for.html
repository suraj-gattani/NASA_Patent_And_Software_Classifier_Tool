Signals transmitted and received by a polarimetric SAR are subject to the Faraday rotation effect (named after the scientist who discovered the phenomenon in 1845) as they traverse the magnetized ionosphere. The ISSI algorithms combine the horizontally and vertically polarized (with respect to the radar system) SAR signals to estimate the radar system calibration parameters and to derive Faraday rotation. The ISSI software package has been designed and developed to integrate the algorithms, process PolSAR data, and image as well as visualize Faraday rotation. In addition, ISSI also computes and visualizes ionospheric total electron content (TEC) along the radio ray path with the Faraday rotation measurement and the International Geomagnetic Field Reference (IGRF) model. Further, ISSI images and visualizes Faraday rotation fluctuations caused by ionospheric scintillation. A number of tests have been conducted using ISSI with PolSAR data collected from various latitude regions using the Phase Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) onboard JAXAs ALOS mission and also with GPS data. These tests have demonstrated and validated SAR-derived ionospheric images and data correction algorithms.
