In the first case, the brightness of the radar images depends on the incidence angle to the mean ground. The second is based on the total of the ground area within the pixel projected to the radar line of sight. For UAVSAR we had to implement a hybrid version by oversampling of the Digital Elevation Model in steered antenna radar Geometry, i.e. the line of sight.
