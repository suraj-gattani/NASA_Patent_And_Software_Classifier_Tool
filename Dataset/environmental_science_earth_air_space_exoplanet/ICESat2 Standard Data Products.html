This software was designed to subset ICESat-2 Standard Data Products. That is, it reads in a single HDF5 ICESat-2 data granule, and uses rules in a control file to reduce the set of prameters according to the rules in the control file, and writes out the resulting file. The purpose of the software is to (a) reduce the size of ICESat-2 Standard Data Product Granules and (b) reduce the number of parameters in an ICESat-2 Standard Data Product granule to those required by a data user. As each user's requirements will be different, the software can subset the granule in a variety of ways, using almost any parameter in the data file as a basis for subsetting.
