The primary goal of the Level 1 Processing software is to: 1. Qualify each data quantity using instrument configuration and checksum data as well as data transmission quality flags. Apply statistical tests for data quality and `reasonableness.' 2. Calibrate the instrument engineering data (e.g., voltages, currents, temperatures and encoder angles). 3. Interpolate filter channel space reference measurements onto the times of each limb measurement and difference the interpolates from the measurements. 4. Interpolate filter channel calibration target measurements onto the times of each limb measurement and compute radiometric gain. 5.Determine the total signal power analyzed by each Digital Autocorrelator Spectrometer (DACS) during each data integration. 6. Convert each DACS data integration from an autocorrelation measurement in the time domain into a spectral measurement in the frequency domain. Finally produce a Log file summarizing instrument performance and outputs.
