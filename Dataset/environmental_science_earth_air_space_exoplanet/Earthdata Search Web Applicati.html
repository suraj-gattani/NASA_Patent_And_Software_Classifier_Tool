Earthdata Search is a web application enabling users to quickly and intuitively discover, search, visualize, and access Earth Science data in a highly visual manner. It interfaces with and demonstrates current state-of-the-art services provided by NASA EOSDIS such as the Common Metadata Repository (CMR) for sub-second search results, the Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) for fast tiled imagery visualizations of data, and OPeNDAP for data access, transformation, and subsetting.
