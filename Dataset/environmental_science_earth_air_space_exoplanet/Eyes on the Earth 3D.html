This software provides a generic means for people to interactively view the real-time location, speed and recent data gatherings of several of NASA's Earth observing Satellites using a 3-D graphical interface. It allows anyone with web access to see where the NASA fleet of Earth Observing satellites are presently or up to a year in the future. It also displays several Earth Science Data sets that have been collected on a daily basis. This is important because it includes near-real-time Earth Science data into a 3D Model of the Earth plus this is the first of it's kind for JPL Earth Science.
