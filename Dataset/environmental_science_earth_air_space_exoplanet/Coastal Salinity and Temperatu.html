The Coastal Salinity and Temperature Monitoring (CSalT) web application Version 1.0, objective is to provide daily access to salinity and temperature data on a continuous and unrestricted basis to authorized users. Numerical model data from multiple sources is collected and integrated with NASA remotely sensed satellite data to provide up-to-date and historical information on water temperature, salinity and oyster lease locations for coastal environments along the Gulf of Mexico. This information is provided in a Google Maps based interface with custom controls for navigation and analysis enabling users to review trends and statistics for their areas of interest. The data can be used to complement in-situ data to help assess oyster health and has the potential to provide information that can aid in the decision making process for identifying suitable habitat for future oyster reef locations.
