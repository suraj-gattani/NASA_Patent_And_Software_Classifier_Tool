PyTDA, an MSFC-based implementation of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Turbulence Detection Algorithm (NTDA), can be used for convective-scale analysis, situational awareness, and forensic meteorology. The software provides Python functions that will estimate turbulence from Doppler radar data. It is written in the Python programming language.
