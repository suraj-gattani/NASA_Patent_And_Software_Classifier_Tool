It is a scientifically important and technologically challenging task to assess quantitatively the impact of a new observation system on our capability of imaging and modeling the ionosphere. This question is often raised whenever a new satellite system is proposed, a new type of data is emerging, or a new modeling technique is developed. This can now be accomplished by using ISOGAME to conduct observation system simulation experiments.
