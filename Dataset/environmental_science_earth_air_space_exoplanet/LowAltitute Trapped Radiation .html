Accurate models of the Earth's trapped energetic proton environment are required for both piloted and robotic space missions. As astronomical and remote sensing detectors become more sensitive, proton flux can induce unwanted backgrounds in the instrumentation. The Low-Altitute Trapped Radiation Model, based on nearly 20 years of data from the TIRO/NOAA weather satellites, predicts the integral omindirectional proton flux in three energy ranges: >16, >36, and >80 MeV. The model contains a true solar cycle variation and accounts for the secular variation in the Earth's magnetic field.
