This Python package will calculate beam blockage in polarimetric weather radar data using the specific differential phase (KDP) and fully self-consistent (FSC) methods of Timothy J. Lang et al. (2009; J. Atmos. Oceanic Technol.). This information can be used to correct the radar data when the radar beams intersect objects like trees, buildings, and mountains.
