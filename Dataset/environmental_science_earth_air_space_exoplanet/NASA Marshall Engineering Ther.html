MET-2007 consists of a computer program and subroutines. For altitude ranges up to 2,500 kilometers, the technology provides information on atmospheric properties as a function of latitude, longitude, time, solar flux, and geomagnetic indices. The model outputs the following parameters: exospheric temperature, local temperature, atmosphere constituent number densities, average molecular weight, total mass density, and total pressure.
