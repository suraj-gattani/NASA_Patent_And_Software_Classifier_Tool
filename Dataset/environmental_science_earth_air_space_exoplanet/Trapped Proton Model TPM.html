TPM determines the differential omnidirectional proton flux from 1 to 100 MeV. At high altitudes, the model is based on CRRESPRO developed by AFRL; at low altitudes, the model is based on data from the TIROS/NOAA (POES) low-altitude polar-orbiting satellites. The model contains a true solar cycle variation and also contains sub-models for quiet and active magnetospheric states.
