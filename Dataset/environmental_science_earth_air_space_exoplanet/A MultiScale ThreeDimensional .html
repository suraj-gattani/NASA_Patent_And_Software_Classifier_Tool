A multi-scale three-dimensional variational data assimilation scheme (MS-3DVAR) has been formulated and the associated software has been developed for high resolution coastal ocean models, aiming to assimilate simultaneously and effectively sparse vertical profiles and high resolution surface measurements, as well as to constrain forward-model biases. In this system, the cost function is decomposed into two separate units for the large and small scale components, respectively.
