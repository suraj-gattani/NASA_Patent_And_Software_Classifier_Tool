The Time Series Product Tool (TSPT) is custom designed software developed to compute and display superior quality Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images from satellite data products for enabling or aiding rapid regional surveillance of canopy greenness for crops, forests, and other vegetative surfaces. TSPT was developed in the MATLAB programming environment, and allows users to compute and display various Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products as single time frame and multi-temporal change images, as time series plots at a selected location, or as temporally processed image videos. This is significant because the labor involved with manually creating these types and quantities of products is considerable; however, by using the TSPT software tool, this process becomes simplified, efficient, and largely automated.
