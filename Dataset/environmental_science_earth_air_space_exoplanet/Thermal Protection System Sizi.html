TPSSZR is an automated thermal protection system (TPS) distribution and sizing analysis code for analyzing space vehicles at the conceptual-design level. The technology automatically generates TPS stackups and aerothermal environment files, maintains consistent material properties descriptions, and has the capability to simultaneously evaluate multiple nominal and abort flight trajectories.
