MultiDop merges three-dimensional variational analysis (3DVAR) software code developed by the University of Oklahoma with the Department of Energy's Python Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) software framework. This enables end users to ingest, correct, and grid their weather radar data using Py-ART, and then pass the radar volumes to MultiDop to synthesize, analyze, and display the 3D winds. An entire science analysis project can thus be done using a shareable Jupyter notebook.
