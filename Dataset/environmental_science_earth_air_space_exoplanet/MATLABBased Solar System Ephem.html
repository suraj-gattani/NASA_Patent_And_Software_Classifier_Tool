This set of MATLAB functions has been used to generate state data (position and velocity) for the Sun, the Earth's moon, and all of the other planets in the solar system. Provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Solar System Dynamics Group, the technology uses Chebychev polynomial fits of numerical integration results for solar system motion. Essentially, the toolbox functions as the MATLAB equivalent of JPL Fortran routines used to construct binary ephemeris files, verify correct installation, and generate state data.
