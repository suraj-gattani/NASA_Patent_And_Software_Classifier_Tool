NASCAP-2K is the next-generation spacecraft charging analysis code. The technology is a comprehensive update to the original NASCAP spacecraft charging codes written twenty years ago. A collaboration of NASA and the U.S. Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), the software builds upon the Air Force's DynaPAC charging algorithms and will replace 3D spacecraft charging codes for all environments.
