The Crisis Mapping Toolkit (CMT) is a collection of tools for processing geospatial data (images, satellite data, etc.) into cartographic products that improve understanding of large-scale crises, such as natural disasters. The cartographic products produced by CMT include flood inundation maps, maps of damaged or destroyed structures, forest fire maps, population density estimates, etc. CMT is designed to rapidly process large-scale data using Google Earth Engine and other geospatial data systems.
