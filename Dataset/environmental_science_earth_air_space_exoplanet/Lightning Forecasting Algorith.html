The Lightning Forecasting Algorithm (LFA) is an algorithm that may be implemented within any cloud-allowing or cloud-resolving numerical forecast model that converts gridded forecasts of updraft speeds and graupel hydrometeor mixing ratios in the mixed phase layer into gridded estimates of total lightning flash rate density.
