The Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) is a modeling software that integrates data from satellites, weather stations, climate models with ecosystem models to produce nowcasts and forecasts of ecological conditions. The key tools used in producing the nowcasts and forecasts are simulation models including biogeochemical and ecosystem models that estimate the states (vegetation leaf area, biomass, soil moisture, snow, etc.) and functions (evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, etc.) of various kinds of plant canopies (forests, crops, grass, shrubs). These ecological nowcasts and forecasts are akin to current and forecast weather conditions. Upon further refinement and testing, the ecological nowcasts and forecasts are useful for making a variety of management decisions such as irrigation scheduling, timing of field operations, preparing for floods/droughts, vector-borne diseases, crop phenology and production.
