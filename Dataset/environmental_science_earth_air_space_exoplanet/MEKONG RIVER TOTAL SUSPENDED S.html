The Mekong River Total Suspended Sediment Software Application (TSS_Mekong) computes the total suspended sediment (TSS) concentrations of the Mekong River from data of the Operational Land Imager (OLI), flying on board of the LANDSAT-8. In this application, computation of TSS follows a two-step process which includes; 1) generating the remote sensing reflectance and/or surface reflectance products using SeaDAS, a NASA comprehensive image analysis package for the processing, display, analysis, and quality control of ocean color data, and 2) running the programgen_tss on the SeaDAS output files to generate the total suspended sediment (TSS) images. The TSS_Mekong was developed with in-situ measurements of the Mekong River waters, acquired by NASA, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and Khon Kaen University of Thailand personnel during March 2016.
