ALIAS supports radiometric and geometric multispectral image processing for the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) instrument onboard NASA's Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite. The radiometric subsystem characterizes and (where possible) corrects: detector operability; gain; bias; coherent, impulse, and random noise; signal-to-noise ratios; saturation levels; striping and banding; and the stability of detector performance. Geometric processing functions support sensor alignment calibrations; sensor chip assembly alignments; modulation transfer function characterizations; image-to-image characterizations; and geodetic accuracy assessments.
