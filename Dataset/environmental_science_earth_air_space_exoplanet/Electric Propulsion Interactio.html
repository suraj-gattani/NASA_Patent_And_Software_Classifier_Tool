EPIC is an interactive computer toolset that enables the construction of a 3D spacecraft model and the assessment of a variety of interactions between the model's subsystems and the plume from an electric thruster. EPIC unites different computer tools to address the many complexities associated with spacecraft/plume interaction processes.
