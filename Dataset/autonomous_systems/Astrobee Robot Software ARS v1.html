Astrobee is a free-flying robot that is designed to operate as a payload inside the International Space Station (ISS). The Astrobee Robot Software (ARS) consists of the embedded (on-board) software and simulator. ARS operates on Astrobees three internal computers and uses the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) framework to link multiple software modules. ARS performs localization and navigation of Astrobee, supports autonomous docking and perching, manages various sensors and actuators, and supports user interaction (via screen-based displays, light signaling, and sound). ARS enables Astrobee to operated in multiple modes: plan-based task execution (command sequencing), teleoperation, or guest science. The simulator allows software simulation of Astrobee mobility without requiring any robot hardware.
