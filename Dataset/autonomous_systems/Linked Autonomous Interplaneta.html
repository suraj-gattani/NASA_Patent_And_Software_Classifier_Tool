The technology being described involves the collection of satellite-to-satellite tracking data between a satellite near the Moon (e.g., a halo orbit about either the lunar L1 or L2 points) and a satellite in GEO orbit. The measurements may be 1-way if both satellites have accurate clocks, or else the measurements must be 2-way measurements. The tracking data is then processed using standard orbit determination methods. The results of navigation studies illustrate clearly that the LiAISON tracking data may be used to track each satellite in absolute space with high accuracy: typically far better than what may be achieved using conventional ground tracking measurements.
