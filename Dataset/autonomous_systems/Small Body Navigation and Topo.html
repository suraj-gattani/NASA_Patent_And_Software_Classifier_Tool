SBN&T provides an integrated program for the spacecraft navigation and determination of small-body dynamics, shape, and high-resolution topography. Multiple-image stereography and photoclinometry are used to construct high-resolution topographic and albedo maps centers treated as control points. These landmark maps are re-illuminated and correlated with images to act as body-fixed navigation tie-points.
