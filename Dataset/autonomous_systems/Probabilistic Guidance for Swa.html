PGA is new method for performing swarm guidance. PGA is probabilistic in nature, and guides the shape of the swarm to conform to a prescribed probability distribution. The main idea is to have each agent follow an independent realization of a Markov chain. The desired distribution emerges as the ensemble of agents in the swarm maneuver about, asymptotically achieving a desired statistical steady-state condition, and eliciting a clear emergent behavior from the swarm. The implementation of the probabilistic guidance law is completely decentralized, and leads to an important swarm behavior that exhibits autonomous self-repair and maintenance capabilities. A simulation of the guided swarm demonstrates the basic properties of convergence and self-repair.
