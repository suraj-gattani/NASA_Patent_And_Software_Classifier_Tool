S4PM is a set of Perl scripts that implement a data-driven processing system that executes science algorithms automatically as new data arrive. S4PM includes a graphical user interface for monitoring algorithms and the overall system for failures. The Perl scripts can currently process data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, but the technology can be extended to process data from other missions if desired.
