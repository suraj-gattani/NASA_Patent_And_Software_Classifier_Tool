The safety system consists of two features: The first part is a system monitor that runs on the quadrotor UAV flight computer to analyze system health. If a critical state is detected the module triggers a safety alert to initiate emergency behaviors like hover in place or emergency landing. The second part is a monitoring module on a base station computer that receives live data from a quadrotor UAV about its internal states (battery level, flight status, planned behavior, etc.) via a wireless link. The module has to monitor and analyze the incoming data and make emergency notifications to the operator, if a critical event occurs (e.g. battery power is bellow critical threshold, or the vehicle is exceeded its pre-programed maximum range).
