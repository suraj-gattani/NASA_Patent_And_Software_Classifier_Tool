Livingstone 2 is a reusable artificial intelligence (AI) software system designed to assist spacecraft, life support systems, chemical plants, or other complex systems in operating robustly with minimal human supervision, even in the face of hardware failures or unexpected events. The technology diagnoses the current state of a spacecraft or other system and recommends commands or repair actions that will allow the system to continue operations. A re-engineered version of the Livingstone diagnosis system that was flight-tested onboard the Deep Space One spacecraft in 1999, Livingstone 2 contains significant enhancements to robustness, performance, and usability. Skunkworks is a suite of software tools that support the rapid deployment of model-based representations of complex systems for Livingstone2 via a visual model builder/tester and two graphical user interface tools that provide status information during testing.
