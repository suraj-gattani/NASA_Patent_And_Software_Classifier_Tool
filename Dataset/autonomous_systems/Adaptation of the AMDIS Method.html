This software will function onboard the ISS to help safe-guard human health by detecting noxious compounds in the air, both in identity and concentration. The stand-alone VCAM instrument was designed to provide an automated method of monitoring air quality within the ISS via a miniaturized mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph system.
