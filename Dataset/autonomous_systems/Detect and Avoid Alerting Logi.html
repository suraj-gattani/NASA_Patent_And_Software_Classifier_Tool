DAIDALUS (Detect and AvoID Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems) is a software library that implements a detect-and-avoid concept for unmanned aircraft systems. At the core of the concept, there is a mathematical definition of the well-clear concept. Two aircraft are considered to be well clear of each other if appropriate distance and time variables determined by the relative aircraft states remain outside a set of predefined threshold values. The main functionality provided by DAIDALUS are: detection logic, maneuver guidance logic (include loss of well-clear recovery), and alerting logic. DAIDALUS 1.0 is the RTCA DO-365 reference implementation of a detect and avoid concept intended to support the integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems into civil airspace. DAIDALUS 2.0 supports a detect and avoid concept for both Phase I (en-route), but also enables the use multiple well-clear volumes, for example for Phase II (terminal-area) operations.
