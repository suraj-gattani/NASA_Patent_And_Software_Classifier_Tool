Independent Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of Unmanned Systems with Distributed On-board Services (ICAROUS-2) is the next generation of the ICAROUS software architecture. As its predecessor, ICAROUS-2 enables the robust integration of mission specific software modules and highly-assured core software modules for building autonomous unmanned aircraft applications. In this new architecture, the core software modules are implemented as distributed on-board services that communicate using a publisher/subscriber communication layer. ICAROUS-2 independent architecture provides support for integration with standard and open source communication and computation layers such as Core Flight Systems (CFS), Data Distribution Service (DDS), MAVLink, and Plan Execution Interchange Language (PLEXIL).
