The Smartphone Video Guidance Sensor (SVGS) allows for calculation of the distance and orientation of an object relative to the SVGS. A known retroreflective target pattern is mounted on the target object. These retroreflectors are then illuminated by the camera flash on the smartphone and imaged by the smartphone camera. The resulting image is processed using photogrammetry algorithms running on the smartphone to extract the relative X, Y, and Z distance and relative orientation, expressed as a roll, pitch, yaw angle sequence.
