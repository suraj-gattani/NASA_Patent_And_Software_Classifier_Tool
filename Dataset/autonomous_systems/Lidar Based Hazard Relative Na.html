The purpose of HRN is to provide measurements to the Navigation Filter so that it can limit errors on the position estimate after hazards have been detected. The hazards are detected by processing a hazard digital elevation map (HDEM). The HRN process takes lidar images as the spacecraft descends to the surface and matches these to the HDEM to compute relative position measurements. This work is directly applicable to manned lunar landing. It is also directly applicable to robotics landers on the moon, other planets and small bodies. It could be used as a sensor approach for navigation of autonomous air vehicles for military and surveillance purposes.
