This NASA software offers the ability to directly trace the real-time execution of software to specific requirements, a unique capability that can only be performed with a Timeliner-TLX system, as no other computer languages directly report this data during execution. The tracing feature does not impose input/output requirements (e.g., print/write statements) on the targeted software because the tracing is performed by an outside program executing separately. The Timeliner-TLX language is currently used for auto-procedures on the International Space Station (ISS) and the Autonomous Mission Operations (AMO) project, and future manned deep-space missions will require the use of extensive auto-procedures to assist in remote intelligent operations.
