The G-PROX guidance algorithm generates fuel-optimal trajectories in the vicinity of asteroids and small bodies. The non-convexity in the control constraints is handled with the lossless convexification technique which consists of a convex relaxation on the control constraints. G-PROX solves a convergent sequence of convex optimization problems generated via sequential linearization of both the dynamics and control bounds synergistically combined with lossless convexification. Sufficient conditions are derived and guarantee that the sequence of convex optimization problems converges to a locally optimal solution of the original nonlinear non-convex problem.
