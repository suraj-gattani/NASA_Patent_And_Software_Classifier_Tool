The Risk-aware Mars Rover Operation Tool will be built upon two existing technologies. One is a machine learning-based terrain classification that is capable of identifying potential hazards, such as pointy rocks and soft terrains, from images. It is based on the random forest algorithm, which has been successfully demonstrated on a DoD-funded project on autonomous ground vehicles. The classifier was trained by 65 training data labeled by human experts. The other one is a risk-aware path planning, which suggest safe paths in consideration of terrain types, slopes, and positive and negative obstacles. It is built upon the rapidly-exploring random graph (RRG) and A* search algorithms.
