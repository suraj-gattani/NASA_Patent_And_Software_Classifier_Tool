The software of RoboSimian, like other JPL autonomous systems, is model-based and data driven. The software consists of multiple processes and modules running simultaneously across two computers inside RoboSimian as well as one remote operator machine. The two RoboSimian computers commmunicate over a Gigabit Ethernet link. Each RoboSimian computer, the high-brain and low-brain machines, runs 12.04 Ubuntu LTS on an Intel Quad-Core i7 with 16GB of memory. The low-brain machine runs a low-latency (soft real-time) kernel and the EtherLab R open-source real-time kernel module, which runs low level processes such as limb and control processes. The high-brain machine is responsible for higher level processes not concerned with real-time execution but rather higher throughput.
