Mystic provides very high-fidelity optimization of low-thrust spacecraft trajectories for mission design. The software can be used for general body-centered trajectories, interplanetary trajectories, and trajectories that combine body-centered and interplanetary trajectory legs. Mystic will also provide navigational/operational support for low-thrust spacecraft.
