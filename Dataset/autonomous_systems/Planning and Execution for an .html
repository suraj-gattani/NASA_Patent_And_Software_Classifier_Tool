The software provides onboard planning and execution technologies to provide robust and opportunistic mission operations for an aerobot. The planning and execution component of AerOASIS is able to generate mission operations plans that achieve science and engineering objectives while respecting mission and resource constraints as well as adapt the plan to respond to new science opportunities. Onboard planning and scheduling for an aerobot is a new capability.
