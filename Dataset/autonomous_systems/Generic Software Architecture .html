The Generic Software Architecture for Prognostics (GSAP) is a generic, extendable, flexible, modular framework for applying prognostics technologies. GSAP manages top-level control, communications, logging, configuration, integration, and other general activities. A simple, standard interface is provided for integrating prognostics algorithms and models, minimizing the work required to deploy prognostics technologies. The standard interface allows for prognosers developed for GSAP to be reused anywhere GSAP is used.
