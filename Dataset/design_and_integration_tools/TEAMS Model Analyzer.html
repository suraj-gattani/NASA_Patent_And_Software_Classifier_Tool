This technology is aimed at helping NASA people conduct modeling activities in the areas of Function Fault Analysis and Ground-based System Diagnostics for the Ares project. The reporting features of the tool allow the modelers to quickly gather statistics about the model and generate an input/output report pertaining to all of the components. The model checking framework allows for rules to be automatically validated against the model and reporting a list of the resulting inconsistencies. The software is attempting to reduce the effort spent in the manual process that each TEAMS modeler must perform in the preparation of reporting for modeling reviews.
