The Jitter Correction software removes frame to frame image translations caused by line of sight motion. This technique could be used on future NASA surface imaging missions to remove the line of sight motion of the orbiting sensor. Jitter_Correct.m is a MATLAB function that takes an image sequence with unknown jitter and computes the translations of each frame (column and row, in pixels) relative to a chosen reference frame.
