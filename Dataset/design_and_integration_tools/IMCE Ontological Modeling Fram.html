JPL's Integrated Model-Centric Engineering (IMCE) initiative developed ontologies for Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to support JPL's MBSE practices and methodologies. The IMCE ontologies have been carefully engineered to provide support for scalable query and reasoning according to the semantics of the Ontology Web Language (OWL) standard in such a way that these ontologies can be mapped as extensions of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) & Systems Modeling Language (SysML) standards.
