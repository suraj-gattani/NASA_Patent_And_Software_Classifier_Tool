The Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP) is an aircraft geometry tool for rapid evaluation of advanced design concepts. Fast and accurate geometry modeling allows the designer to use more complex analysis methods earlier in the design process and reduces reliance on empiricism in conceptual design. VSP includes tools to model and export the internal structural layout.
