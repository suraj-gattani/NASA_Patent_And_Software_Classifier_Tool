The Navigation Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at Caltech's JPL,acting under the directions of NASA's Office of Space Science, has built a datasystem, named SPICE, to assist scientists in planning and interpreting scientificobservations. SPICE provides geometric and some other ancillary information neededto recover the full value of science instrument data, including correlation ofindividual instrument data sets with data from other instruments on the same or otherspacecraft.
