Our objective is to estimate Coriolis force and torque applied to the vehicle during its ascent. We use Maveric flight simulation software to produce the required angular velocity data for the Coriolis force and torque computations. For the simulation of gas movement in SRB we developed software using a dynamical model of internal ballistics of the five-segmented SRB. We investigate both flexible and rigid rocket models. We also study and estimate Coriolis force and torque applied to the rocket due to SRB nozzle movement. For calculation of internal ballistics, Coriolis force, and torque computations we use Matlab software.
