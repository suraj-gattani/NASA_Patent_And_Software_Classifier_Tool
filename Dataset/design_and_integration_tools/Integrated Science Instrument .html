The Integrated Science Instrument Models (ISIM) hardware models are Wind River Simics Device Modeling Language (DML) models for the ISIM Command and Data Handling (ICDH) electrical components; Housekeeping card (HK), Bus Interface Card (BIC), and Focal Plane Array Processor (FPAPs). The models allow the ISIM flight software to be executed within a COTS emulator product, Wind River Simics. This technology was primarily developed under the NASA IV&V Chief Engineer Support contract with contributions from the 2013 GSFC Software Simulations for Spacecraft Development IRAD (HK model and verification work) to support JWST IV&V work.
