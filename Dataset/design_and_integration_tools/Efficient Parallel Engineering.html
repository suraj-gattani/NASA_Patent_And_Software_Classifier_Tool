This software provides an off-the-shelf approach to high-performance engineering computing that finds numerous applications in NASA aeronautical and space mission analysis and simulations. A C software module has been developed that creates light weight processes (LWP) dynamically to achieve parallel computing performance in a variety of engineering simulation and analysis applications.
