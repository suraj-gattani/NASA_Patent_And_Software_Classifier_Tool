LAURA.5 is a structured, multi-block, computational aerothermodynamic simulation code. It provides a major refactoring of the original LAURA code in a modular structure utilizing Fortran 95. The technology shares gas physics modules, MPI modules, and some fundamental data set modules with the unstructured-grid code FUN3D.
