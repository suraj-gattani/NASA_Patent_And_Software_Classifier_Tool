USM3D is a tetrahedral unstructured flow solver that has become widely used in industry, government, and academia for solving aerodynamic problems. Since its first introduction in 1989, USM3D has steadily evolved from an inviscid Euler solver into a full viscous Navier-Stokes code. The technology has been a part of the NASA TetrUSS system.
