This software implements the NTP algorithm for Space communications and can be used as a basis for further higher TRL prototype or flight software development. It is an implementation to test the functionality of NTP basic and interleaved Symmetric algorithm that can be integrated with CCSDS Prox-1 to provide the time distribution and synchronization service.
