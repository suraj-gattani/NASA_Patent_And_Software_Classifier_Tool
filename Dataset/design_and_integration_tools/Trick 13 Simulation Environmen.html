The Trick Simulation environment is a generic simulation toolkit used for constructing and running simulations. The Trick 13 Interface Code Generator (ICG), a utility that provides math model class and structure layout data, has been rewritten and is based off of the open source clang/llvm project. The Trick numerical integrators have been replaced with a common set of integrators. Several core components are enhanced from previous Trick versions. Trick 13 is now Open Source software and can be downloaded at http://code.nasa.gov/#/
