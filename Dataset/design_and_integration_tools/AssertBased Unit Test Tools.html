The ut-assert unit test tools provide a unit test framework and a collection of utilities that are designed to facilitate unit testing. These tools implement an assertion-based testing philosophy that requires the developer to explicitly write verification statements that assert whether a condition is true or false. This approach is much different than the Flight Software Branch's historical approach to unit testing that creates a log file that requires developer analysis in order to determine whether a test passed or failed. In order to use the tools a developer populates the framework with their unit tests and links with the ut-asssert library to create an executable.
