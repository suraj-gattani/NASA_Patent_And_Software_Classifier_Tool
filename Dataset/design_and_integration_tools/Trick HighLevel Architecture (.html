This framework removes the complexity of adhering to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1516-2000 High-Level Architecture (HLA) standards for simulation interoperability. The framework is data driven and includes a simple application programming interface (API), making it relatively easy to enhance an existing Trick simulation into a distributed simulation.
