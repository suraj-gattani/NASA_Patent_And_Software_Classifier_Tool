Savors is a tool for security event monitoring, analysis, and response. The technology scales to real-world environments and uses high-end computing resources on-demand to compile behavior profiles that point to anomalous behavior. Auralization allows both monitoring and analysis to be performed in parallel and draws attention to critical events in one tool when utilizing another. Remote data access and response capabilities across distributed resources are enabled using grid computing that provides a secure, single sign-on environment.
