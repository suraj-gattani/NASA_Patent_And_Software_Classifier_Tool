This software enables automatic image registration, which is a first step towards automatic change detection. Change detection is a key method for study of dynamic processes on planetary bodies. The software requires minimal user input and performs a registration over scale and in-plane rotation fully automatically. This tool is a steppingstone for automatic change detection from aerial/orbital imagery. This software enables automatic image registration, which is a first step towards automatic change detection. Change detection is a key method for study of dynamic processes on planetary bodies.
