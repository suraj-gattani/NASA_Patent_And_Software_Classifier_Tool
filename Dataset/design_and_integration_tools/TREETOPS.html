TREETOPS is a time history simulation of the motion of a complex multi-body flexible structures with active control elements. The name TREETOPS refers to the class of structures which may be simulated by the program, i.e., those having a tree topology (where loop closures are handled with a cut graph technique). TREETOPS offers the user an advanced capability for analyzing the dynamics and control-related issues of such structures.
