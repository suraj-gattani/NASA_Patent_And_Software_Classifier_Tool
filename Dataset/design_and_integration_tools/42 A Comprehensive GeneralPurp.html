Simulator of spacecraft attitude, orbit dynamics, and environmental models. Spacecraft models composed of multiple bodies are supported. The environment models include ephemerides for all planets and major moons in the solar system. Supports geometrical visualization through an OpenGL interface. The simulator is opensource and portable across computing platforms, making it customizable and extensible. It is written to support the entire GNC design cycle, from rapid prototyping and design analysis, to high-fidelity flight code verification.
