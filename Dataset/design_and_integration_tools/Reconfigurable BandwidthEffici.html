A Re-configurable Bandwidth-Efficient Transmit Waveform for High-rate Telemetry has been developed for space communications, intended for implementation on software-defined radio (SDR) technology. The waveform is designed to optimize the data-throughput through NASA's Space Network, in particular, the Ku-band or Ka-band single-access service, which has 225 MHz of available bandwidth. The waveform is written in Very-high speed integrated circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL), appropriate for space-qualified Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).
