The Goddard Satellite Data Simulation Unit (SDSU) is a comprehensive unified system of multi-sensor satellite instrumental simulators. Skill of weather forecasting models can be evaluated in terms of satellite-observed multi-sensor radiance levels. Alternatively, the remote sensing community can more readily utilize atmospheric model simulations to develop and test their retrieval algorithms for application of Earth science.
