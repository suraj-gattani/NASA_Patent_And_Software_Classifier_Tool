UQTools is a MATLAB-based software package designed to efficiently analyze dynamic systems subject to parametric uncertainty. UQTools accepts uncertainty models based upon both probabilistic and non-probabilistic definitions, and it realizes several complementary methods for performing a variety of uncertainty quantification tasks.
