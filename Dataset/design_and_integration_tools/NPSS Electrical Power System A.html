An electrical power system analysis tool that can integrate with traditional combustion based propulsion models to analyze the potential benefits of aircraft electrification in the NPSS environment. This toolbox basic (text book based) electrical power system component models and an electrical port which connects these component models together to ensure the correct data is available to each model. The toolbox sizes the electrical power system based on required load demand at the design point and determines the power available to the loads in off-design.
