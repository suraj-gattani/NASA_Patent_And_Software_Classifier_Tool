This software helps designers of hybrid airships to understand the effects of aerodynamic and thruster performance on steady-state flight mechanics. The software is capable of producing a large number of useful plots and requires only basic geometric, mass, and aerodynamic data to describe the vehicle. The resultant plots and plotting script are compatible with a widely used and freely available plotting package.
