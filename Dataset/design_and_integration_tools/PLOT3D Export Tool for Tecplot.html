The PLOT3D Export Tecplot addon is a runtime library linked into Tecplot at the time of startup of the Tecplot software. It enables Tecplot users the ability to output PLOT3D style files from Tecplot as a grid, grid and solution, or grid and function file for use by another computer code. Existing functionality of Tecplot only offers input of PLOT3D data and output of image data or Tecplot proprietary formatted data. The PLOT3D Exporter addon thus enables the use of Tecplot as a generation and manipulation of grid and solution data for output to flow solvers. In this capacity, Tecplot can be used to interpolate old solutions onto new grids imported into Tecplot or created within the Tecplot software. The output of PLOT3D data also enables use of Tecplot to convert solutions from other flow solvers into a standard PLOT3D data set. Thus, the PLOT3D Export addon significantly enhances Tecplot capabilities for use by computational science applications.
