NEQAIR is a line-by-line radiation code that computes spontaneous emission, absorption and stimulated emission due to transitions between various energy states of chemical species along a line-of-sight. NEQAIR v14.0 is a complex code that enables the calculation of: (1) Nonequlibrium or equilibrium populations of excited energy levels for atomic and diatomic molecules, (2) Optical radiation emitted and absorbed by atomic and diatomic rotational lines along a line-of-sight or across a shock tube, (3)Transport of optical radiation through a non uniform gas mixture to a solid surface and (4) Detailed spectra at points along a line-of-sight and at a surface and plots them.
