For this architecture, IF data from multiple antennas is digitized using Analog to Digital Converters at a rate of 1280 Msamples/second or greater. The digitized data is broken up into sub-bands using a Modified Discrete Fourier Transform Filterbank. The MDFT is a critically sampled filterbank that allows for near perfect reconstruction. The critically sampled property provides for optimal use of limited data bandwidth resources.
