Normalized cross correlation measures how closely a small template image compares to a larger search image at each point in the search image. The cross correlation score is adjusted to reduce the influence of contrast and brightness across the search image resulting in a normalized cross correlation score in the range -1.0 .. 1.0 at each point, where 1.0 is returned for a perfect match.
