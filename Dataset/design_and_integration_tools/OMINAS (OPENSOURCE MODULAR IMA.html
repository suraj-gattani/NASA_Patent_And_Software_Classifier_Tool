The primary motivation for the development of this software was to separate the analysis part of the problem from the data-specific part. This allows the exact same software to be used for multiple missions as needed; the only requirement for new mission input is the creation of a translator specific to that data source. Provides an API and for developing tools for astronomical data analysis.
