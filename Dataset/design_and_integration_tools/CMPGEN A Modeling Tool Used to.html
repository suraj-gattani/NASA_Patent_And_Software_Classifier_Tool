CMPGEN is a modeling tool used to compute off-design performance of axial fans, boosters, and compressors. Users can obtain rapid and consistent off-design performance characteristics from simple design point inputs. Component performance maps suitable for use in the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) gas turbine engine cycle analysis code output.
