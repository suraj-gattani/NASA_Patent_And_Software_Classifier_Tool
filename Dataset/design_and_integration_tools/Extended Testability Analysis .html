This technology disclosure is for the Enhanced Testability Analysis (ETA) Tool V8.0. The version of the ETA Tool is an upgrade of the previous reported ETA Tool (LEW-18795-1). This technology is a NASA Glenn-developed software application that supports fault management (FM) by performing testability analyses on the fault propagation model of a given system. The Extended Testability Analysis (ETA) Tool processes a diagnostic model developed from a commercial software package called TEAMS Designer using a defined set of modeling conventiuons and practices. ETA Tool can provide an assessment of the modeled system based on diagnostic metrics of detectability and failure isolation. The program can provide assessment of a system's detection coverage, test utilization, failure isolation at the root cause or at the component levels, generate a FMEA Report, perform sensor sensitivity studies and provide a trace-mapping of failure modes to higher level system effects. ETA Tool generates reports from each selected analysis option in both an HTML and XML format to enable user access in either standard web browsers or loadable into an Microsoft Excel workbook for review/editing.
