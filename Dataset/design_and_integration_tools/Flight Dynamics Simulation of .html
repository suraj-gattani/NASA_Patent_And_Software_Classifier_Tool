This software is a flight dynamics simulation of a transport aircraft. It implements general rigid body equations of motion for the vehicle dynamics and draws aerodynamic forces from a standard coefficient expansion implemented as table lookups. Dynamics of actuator servos and bandwidth of sensors are also included. The simulation is coded in Simulink, a model-based environment using a commercial simulation package from Mathworks, Inc. The software is not stand-alone; it must be run from inside this commercial environment, making use of numerical libraries for basic operations as well as the overall time-stepping and numerical integration routines.
