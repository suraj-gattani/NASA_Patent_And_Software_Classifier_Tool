Degra is relevant to NASA current and future work. Degra is currently being used by the Mars Science Laboratory project for prediction of MMRTG performance on Mars. In addition Degra is to be used for future SMD missions where RTG power generation is applied. Degra is a generalized simulation of the performance and degradation of a radioisotope thermoelectric Generator (RTG) over its lifetime. It is provided with a graphical user interface (GUI) which is used to edit the input parameters which describe the initial state of the RTG and the time-varying loads and environment to which it will be exposed.
