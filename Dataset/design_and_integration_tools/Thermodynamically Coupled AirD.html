This one dimensional (1D) numerical model (software) simulates icing wind tunnels by modeling the thermodynamic interactions between the water/ice particles of an icing cloud and the flowing air. The model attempts to explain the observed changes in test conditions at the tunnel test section, such as air temperature and humidity, when an icing cloud is activated. The ultimate goal of the model is to better understand the complex interactions between the known test parameters at the tunnel inlet and have greater confidence in the conditions at the test section of the tunnel. The model provides simulated results at the tunnel test section which includes air temperature, vapor content (humidity), air velocity, cloud liquid and ice water content, cloud particle size distribution, cloud particle velocities, and cloud particle temperatures. The model can simulate supercooled liquid clouds (water that freezes below 0 degrees Celsius) as well as standard water clouds (water that freezes at 0 degrees Celsius). Model inputs include initial air temperature, air pressure, air humidity, cloud water content, cloud ice content, cloud ice/water temperature, cloud water type (regular water or deionized water that can supercool), cloud ice/water speed, cloud particle size distribution, and expected exit air velocity. There is also an input for the tunnel geometry
