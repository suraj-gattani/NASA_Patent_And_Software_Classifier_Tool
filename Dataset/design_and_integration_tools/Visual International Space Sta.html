The Visual International Space Station Configuration Viewer (VIC) is a software tool to assist with visualizing and communicating the current and potential ISS configuration to a wide audience. The tool consists of a simplified 3 dimensional model of the ISS external configuration that allows the user to interact using a mouse or keyboard (e.g. drag, pan, rotate, zoom) and manually reconfigure the IS with pre-defined elements, vehicles and cargo to assist with visualizing ISS during trade study and Ops Con development and during presentations.
