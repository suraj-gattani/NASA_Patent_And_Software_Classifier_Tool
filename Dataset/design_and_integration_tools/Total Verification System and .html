This technology verifies complex space flight digital designs in a more thorough manner than was previously possible while offering cost savings and reduced schedule time. The software combines a custom-designed GSE unit, the Total Verification System, along with a powerful test bench environment that uses C . Together, these elements allow a high level of code reuse between all the phases of the design and test cycle.
