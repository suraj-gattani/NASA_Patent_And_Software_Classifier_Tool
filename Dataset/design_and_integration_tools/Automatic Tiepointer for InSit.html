The marsautotie program generates tiepoints for use with the Mars pointing correction software in a completely automated manner, with no operator intervention. It takes input images and finds overlaps according to the nominal pointing. It then finds the most "interesting" areas using a scene activity metric. Those points with most scene activity are most likely to be useful for tiepointing a mosaic. It then uses correlation techniques to find matching points in the overlapped image. Finally, it performs a series of steps to reduce the number of tiepoints to a manageable level.
