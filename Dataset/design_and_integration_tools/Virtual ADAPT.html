Virtual ADAPT is a MATLAB/Simulink simulation of the Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT) located at NASA Ames Research Center. ADAPT is an electrical power system testbed that emulates the power distribution systems on spacecraft. It allows users to inject faults, in order to study how faults affect the operation of the electrical power system, and to evaluate automated diagnostics technologies. Virtual ADAPT provides a high-fidelity simulation of this capability. It includes dynamic models of all the components of ADAPT and enables all faults that can be injected into the actual testbed to be injected into the simulation, including some that would be difficult or unsafe to do in the actual hardware. In this way, simulated fault scenarios can be quickly generated under many possible conditions, generating simulated data that closely matches what the behavior of the actual testbed would be. This simulated data can then be used for diagnostics algorithm development and testing, before testing on the actual hardware or deploying to a real application.
