PyCycle is a novel software library written in the Python Programming language. It allows a user to perform standard engine cycle analysis, while also providing analytic derivative (sensitivity) calculations to the end user. This allows Pycycle to be very efficiently used by (or incorporated within) external software programs performing broader simulation, analysis, and optimization.
