ICAN/JAVA, the Integrated Composite Analyzer written in Java, was primarily designed to analyze the hygrothermomechanical response and properties of fiber- or particulate-reinforced, resin-matrix layered composite materials, given the local membrane loads and bending moments. ICAN/JAVA was coded in the Java computer language combining features from earlier versions for both fibers and particulates as well as adding impact modeling. The multi-factor interaction model allows factors to interact to allow for property changes due to operating conditions after fabrication. ICAN/JAVA has both a batch version and an interactive version that can also plot selected outputs.
