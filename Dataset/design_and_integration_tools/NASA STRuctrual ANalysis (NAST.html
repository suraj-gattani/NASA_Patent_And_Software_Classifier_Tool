NASTRAN is a finite element analysis program that was originally developed for NASA in the late 1960s under U.S. government funding for the aerospace industry. The software suite provides engineers a comprehensive simulation solution for insight into structural behavior. NASTRAN source code is integrated in a number of different software packages, which are distributed by a range of companies.
