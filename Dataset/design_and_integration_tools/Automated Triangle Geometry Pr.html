Cart3D is a high-fidelity inviscid analysis package for conceptual and preliminary aerodynamic design. It allows users to perform automated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis on complex geometry. The package includes utilities for geometry import, surface modeling and intersection, mesh generation, and flow simulation. Cart3D is highly automated so that geometry acquisition and mesh generation can usually be performed within a matter of minutes on most modern UNIX workstations or PCs.
