The primary observation is that the telescope boresight can slew slowly while the mirror system maintains pointing on a specific field of view. This allows us to continually gather data (much like push-broom instruments) without needing to slew or settle, increasing the overall efficiency of the data collection. And since the telescope field of view is much larger than the imager field of view, we can divide the areas to be imaged (to a finite extent.) The approach we describe here requires us to divide the telescope fields of view into quarters, half along each dimension.
