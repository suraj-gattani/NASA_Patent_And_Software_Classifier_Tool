Different mission architectures, ranging from support of human-based exploration to fully autonomous rovers, dramatically affect the cost, safety, and science return of lunar and planetary missions. Mission durations may range from days to months and affect the mission architecture that will be developed and deployed. Architecture tradeoff analysis plays a key role in assessing which mission scenarios offer the maximal science productivity and crew safety while minimizing development and operational costs.
