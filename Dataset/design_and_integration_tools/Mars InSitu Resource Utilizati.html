Mars In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) Propellant Production Discrete Event Simulation (DES)- MIPP-D MIPP-D is a Simio based Discrete Event Simulation modeling Mars surface propellant production. The focus is on the actual chemical plant and processes, including incoming and outgoing materials, associated with the production of rocket fuel on Mars. The fuel will be for the Mars Ascent Vehicle used to carry humans into space from the surface of Mars. The Simulation utilizes NASA ground rules and assumptions as well as data from prototype chemical plants, NASA experts and literature. The Simulation is designed to grow in capability and complexity as needed or as additional information becomes available. The simulation does not attempt to model the complexities of surface elements acquiring feed stock or disposing of spent resources, although it does acknowledge those functions exist and uses informed assumptions where necessary.
