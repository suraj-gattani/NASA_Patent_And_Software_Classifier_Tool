The Chimera Grid Tools software package is used for performing pre- and post-processing of computational fluid dynamics analysis on complex configurations using overset grids. It contains a collection of software tools for performing geometry processing, surface and volume grid generation, grid manipulation and diagnostics, flow solver input preparation, multi-body dynamics input preparation and animation, flow solution visualization, debris trajectory analysis input preparation, strand grid and AMR Cartesian grid visualization, flow solution post-processing analysis including forces and moments computation, and convergence history visualization.
