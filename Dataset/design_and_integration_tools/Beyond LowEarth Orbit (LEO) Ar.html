A user-friendly, configurable spacecraft sizing tool, BLAST provides a shareable, re-creatable and rigorous end-to-end multi-element architecture framework that has been used to generate mass data for in-space, beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) transportation vehicles and architectures. Offering a novel approach to modeling, BLAST couples extensive MER research with the ability to assess mission changes instantaneously by analyzing sensitivity sweeps of several parameters at once.
