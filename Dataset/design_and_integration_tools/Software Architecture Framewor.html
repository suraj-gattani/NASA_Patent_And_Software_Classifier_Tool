SAFE-DART is a framework designed to increase the extensibility and flexibility of a software system written in C++ and utilizing the Qt C++ framework from The Qt Company. SAFE-DART adds flexibility to the software system by making it simple to change Computer Software Components (CSC) by selecting from multiple implementations provided by the software system in a way that can be controlled by the user at run-time. SAFE-DART also allows the use of modules to provide additional CSC implementations without the need to alter the original software system, allowing additional functionality to be added to the system even at run-time.
