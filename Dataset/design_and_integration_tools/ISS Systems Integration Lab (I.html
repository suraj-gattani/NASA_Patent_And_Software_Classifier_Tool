The Software Development and Integration Laboratory (SDIL) in Sonny Carter supports ISS Flight Software development, integration and verification. The complexity of the ISS requires efficient and reliable test reconfiguration, flexible resource scheduling, effective workflow and at the same time effective configuration management. An electronic workflow system was conceived, dubbed Rig Information Management (RIM). The SDIL was then transitioned from standalone, manual systems to the RIM system with database-centric, web-based solutions enabling significant efficiencies and paperless operations. It also created productivity improvements in flight software development and sustaining. This innovation has been recognized with a JSC 2007 Exceptional Software Award.
