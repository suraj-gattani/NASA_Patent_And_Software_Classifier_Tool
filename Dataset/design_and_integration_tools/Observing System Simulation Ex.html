This software is for the optimal instrument design for Earth-observing missions that depend on the complicated interplay between atmospheric radiative transfer, surface characteristics, orbital geometry, retrieval algorithms, and science objectives. It accomplishes this by implementing an Observing System Simulation Environment (OSSE) and is used to demonstrate science return for proposed instruments by modeling the whole ground truth, sensing, and retrieval chain.
