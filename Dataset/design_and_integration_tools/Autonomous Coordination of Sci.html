This autonomous science system for multiple spacecraft assets was integrated with the Interplanetary Network DTN (Delay Tolerant Network) to provide communication between spacecraft assets. The full integrated system was then demonstrated at the JPL Mars Yard where it was shown to autonomously coordinate observations between multiple spacecraft, including a field test rover, multiple fixed landed assets, and multiple field test orbiters.
