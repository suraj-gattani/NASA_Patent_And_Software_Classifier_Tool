This software can be used by light project funded by NASA. This interface can also be used by other airborne scienceinstruments.Some of the main features of the interface include drawing flight lines on the map, nudging them, adding them to the current flight plan, and reordering them. The user can also search and select takeoff, landing, and intermediate airports. As the flight plan is constructed, all of its components are constantly being saved to the database and the estimated flight times are updated.
