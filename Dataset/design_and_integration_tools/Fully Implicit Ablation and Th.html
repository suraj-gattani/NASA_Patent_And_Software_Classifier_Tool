FIAT v3 simulates one-dimensional thermal energy transport in a multilayer stack of isotropic materials and structures that can ablate from the front surface and decompose in depth. The implicit solution algorithm and general solution technique make the program very stable and robust for application to both robotic and crewed vehicles entering a planetary atmosphere from space. For input, the code reads material property information from a database file.
