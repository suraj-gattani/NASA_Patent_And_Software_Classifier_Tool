CFL3D is a structured-grid, cell-centered, upwind-biased, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) code. It can be run in parallel on multiple grid zones with point-matched, patched, overset, or embedded connectivities. Both multigrid and mesh sequencing are available in time-accurate or steady-state modes.
