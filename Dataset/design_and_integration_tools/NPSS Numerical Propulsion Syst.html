NASA Glenn Research Center is developing a common collaborative full engine simulation tool for the U.S. Government, aerospace industry, and academia called the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS). NPSS provides an environment for the analysis and design of propulsion systems for thermodynamic systems. The NPSS focuses on the potential integration of multiple disciplines such as aerodynamics, structures, and heat transfer, along with the concept of numerical zooming between 0-Dimensional to 1-, 2-, and 3- Dimensional component engine codes.
