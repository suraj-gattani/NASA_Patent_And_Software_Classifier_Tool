EDLFLOW-F solves the unsteady three-dimensional equations for compressible flow using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration scheme and a sixth- and/or tenth-order compact differencing scheme for spatial derivatives. Deforming geometry simulations can be carried out using this solver. The technology can also be used in a low-order mode as a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver. Any flow regime-from incompressible flow to hypersonic flow about arbitrary geometries-can be simulated using EDLFLOW-F.
