SCRUB is a code review tool that supports both large team-based software development efforts (e.g., for mission software) and individual programming tasks. The tool was developed at JPL to support a new streamlined code review process that combines human generated review reports with program-generated analyses reports from a customizable range of state-of-the-art source code analyzers. All reports are accessed through a single uniform interface that facilitates browsing code and reports.
