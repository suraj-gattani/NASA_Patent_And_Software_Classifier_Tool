SOCIT is a collection of functions, written in MATLAB language and expressed in M-files, that implements a variety of modern system identification techniques. For an open-loop system, it features functions for identification of a system model and corresponding forward and backward observers directly from input and output data. For a closed-loop system, SOCIT identifies an open-loop model, an observer, and corresponding controller gain directly from input and output data.
