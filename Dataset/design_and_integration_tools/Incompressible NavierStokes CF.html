The INS3D code solves the incompressible Naiver-Stokes equations in three-dimensional generalized coordinates for both steady-state and time varying flow. The equations are formulated using the method of artificial compressibility. The convective terms are differenced using an upwind biased flux-difference splitting. The equations are solved using an implicit line-relaxation scheme. The code is written for single or multiple-zone calculations. It can utilize either pointwise continuous zonal interfaces, or overset zonal interfaces if a PEGASUS interpolation database is supplied. The INS3D code is written in Fortran77 and C. The code only runs in a serial execution mode. This code was developed in the 1990s and is no longer under development at NASA.
