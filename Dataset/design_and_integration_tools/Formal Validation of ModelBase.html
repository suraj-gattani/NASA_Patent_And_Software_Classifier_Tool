Generic SysML fault protection behavior model patterns were established and SMAP fault protection logical design was implemented into the model (included a subset of SMAP devices, error monitors and responses). Multiple fault injection tests were run to ensure correct behavior of the model and to produce auto-generated event reports. Once the model accurately represented the logical design, it was transformed to Java and executed in JPF with assertions (domain specific constraints). Upon completion of an exhaustive check in JPF, the logical design of the system is validated against domain specific constraints. The model checking performance and results can be found in the attached document (Formal Validation of Model-Based Fault Management Design Solutions).
